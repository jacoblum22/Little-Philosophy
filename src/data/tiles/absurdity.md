Absurdity is what you get when an unstoppable force — the human need for meaning — meets an immovable object — a universe that offers none.

Humans can't help it. We look for patterns, purposes, reasons. We ask "why?" about everything: why we suffer, why we're here, why anything exists at all. But what if the universe simply doesn't have answers to those questions? Not because we haven't found them yet, but because they don't exist? That collision — between our desperate demand for meaning and the world's silent indifference — is what Albert Camus called the Absurd.

Camus didn't invent the idea, but he gave it its sharpest expression. In *The Myth of Sisyphus*, he starts with what he calls "the only truly serious philosophical problem": suicide. If life is meaningless, why go on living? His answer is surprising. He rejects both suicide and the "philosophical suicide" of leaping into religious faith or abstract systems that paper over the absurdity. Instead, he says we should *live in* the absurdity — acknowledge it fully while refusing to surrender to it. Sisyphus, condemned to roll a boulder uphill for eternity only to watch it roll back down, becomes Camus's hero precisely because he keeps going with full awareness of his situation. "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

The idea has deep roots. The Book of Ecclesiastes — "vanity of vanities, all is vanity" — expresses something similar thousands of years earlier. Kierkegaard explored the absurd as a religious category: faith itself is absurd, a leap beyond reason. But where Kierkegaard leaped, Camus stayed on the ground. For him, the honest response to absurdity is revolt — not political revolution, but the quiet, persistent refusal to pretend the gap between desire and reality isn't there.

What makes absurdity such a powerful idea is that it doesn't ask you to give up on life. It asks you to give up on the fantasy that life owes you an explanation — and then to live fully anyway. There's something strangely liberating in that. If nothing matters cosmically, then you're free to decide what matters to you.
