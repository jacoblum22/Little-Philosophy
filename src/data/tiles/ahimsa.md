Ahimsa is the principle of non-harm — the commitment to avoiding violence in thought, word, and deed toward all living beings.

The word comes from Sanskrit: *a-* (not) + *hiṃsā* (harm, injury). It appears in the oldest Indian texts and is a foundational ethical principle across Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism — though each tradition interprets it differently.

In Jainism, ahimsa is the supreme ethical principle, taken to its most radical extreme. Jain monks sweep the ground before them to avoid stepping on insects, strain their water to avoid swallowing tiny organisms, and wear cloth over their mouths to prevent inhaling small creatures. This isn't environmentalism in the modern sense — it's metaphysical. Every living being has a soul (*jīva*), and every act of violence generates karma that binds the soul to the cycle of rebirth. Ahimsa is, literally, the path to liberation.

In Hindu philosophy, ahimsa appears in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali as the first of the *yamas* — the ethical restraints that form the foundation of yogic practice. The Mahabharata calls it the highest dharma. But Hinduism also struggles with ahimsa's limits. The Bhagavad Gita famously presents a crisis: Arjuna, a warrior, must fight a just war against his own family. Krishna's counsel isn't to avoid violence but to act without attachment to results. Absolute ahimsa and the duties of worldly life exist in tension, and the Hindu tradition has wrestled with that tension for millennia.

The Buddha taught ahimsa as part of right action: not killing, not harming. But Buddhist ahimsa extends beyond physical violence to the mental states that produce it — hatred, cruelty, indifference. The real battleground is internal.

In the 20th century, Gandhi made ahimsa a political force. His version wasn't passive. *Satyagraha* — nonviolent resistance — was active, confrontational, and courageous. It demanded more strength, Gandhi argued, than fighting back. Martin Luther King Jr. carried this tradition forward, showing that ahimsa could challenge systemic injustice without replicating its violence.

Ahimsa asks a deceptively simple question: what would it look like to take seriously the suffering of every living being? The answers have shaped civilizations.
