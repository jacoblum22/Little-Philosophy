Aletheia is the ancient Greek word for truth — but it carries a meaning that our modern concept of truth has largely lost: *unconcealment*, the act of bringing what is hidden into the light.

We usually think of truth as a property of statements. "The cat is on the mat" is true if, in fact, the cat is on the mat. This is the correspondence theory of truth, and it works well enough for everyday purposes. But the Greeks — and particularly Heidegger, who built a philosophy around the word — heard something different in *aletheia*. The word literally means "un-forgetting" or "un-hiding" (*a-* = un-, *lethe* = concealment, forgetting). Truth isn't a static match between words and facts. It's an event: something that was hidden *reveals itself*.

This matters because it implies that concealment is the default state. Reality doesn't just sit there waiting to be accurately described. It hides. It withdraws. Getting at the truth is a struggle *against* concealment — against appearances, assumptions, habits of thought, and the comfortable fog of everyday life. The river Lethe in Greek mythology, whose waters made the dead forget their past lives, shares the same root. Truth is what you get when you resist forgetting.

Heidegger argued that Western philosophy took a wrong turn when it reduced truth to correctness — the accurate representation of objects by a subject. This flattened something dynamic into something static. For the pre-Socratics, Heidegger claimed, truth was a happening: the way a clearing opens in a forest, letting light in while the surrounding darkness remains. Things show themselves *and* hide themselves simultaneously. Every act of uncovering also covers something else over.

Whether or not you follow Heidegger all the way, aletheia captures something important: that truth is not just about having the right answers. It's about the effort of seeing clearly — about paying attention to what reveals itself, while remaining humble about everything that still hides.
