Alterity is the radical otherness of another person — the irreducible fact that they are not you, cannot be fully understood by you, and should not be reduced to your categories.

We constantly try to make sense of other people by fitting them into frameworks we already have. She's "like me," he's "a certain type," they're "from that culture." These categories help us navigate the social world, but they also domesticate the genuinely foreign, turning an encounter with another consciousness into a recognition of something familiar. Alterity names what escapes this process — the stubborn surplus in another person that can never be captured by your concepts.

Emmanuel Levinas built his entire philosophy around this idea. For Levinas, the encounter with the Other's face is the foundational ethical experience. When you look into someone's face, you encounter something that exceeds every category, every image, every representation. The face "speaks" before any words are exchanged: it says, silently, "Do not kill me." Ethics, for Levinas, doesn't begin with rights or duties or calculations of happiness. It begins with this naked encounter — the revelation that another person makes a claim on you simply by existing.

This was partly a response to the horrors of the 20th century. Levinas, a Lithuanian Jew who survived World War II in a prisoner-of-war camp while most of his family was murdered in the Holocaust, saw clearly what happens when alterity is denied — when entire groups of people are reduced to categories, stereotypes, and abstractions. The philosophical tradition's obsession with totality — with systems that explain everything — had, in his view, contributed to this catastrophe by teaching people to assimilate the Other into the Same.

Simone de Beauvoir explored alterity from a different angle in *The Second Sex*: woman has historically been constructed as the Other to man's Subject — the deviation, the mystery, the not-quite-human. Postcolonial thinkers like Edward Said showed how "the Orient" was constructed as Europe's Other. In each case, the pattern is the same: one group defines itself as the norm and pushes everyone else into the category of the strange and subordinate.

Alterity insists that this move fails — that the Other is always more than what you make of them, and that respecting that excess is where ethics begins.
