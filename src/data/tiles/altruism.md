Altruism is acting for the good of others at a cost to yourself — genuinely, without expecting anything in return.

It sounds straightforward, even admirable. But the moment you examine it philosophically, altruism becomes deeply puzzling. Does it really exist? Every apparently selfless act seems to come with hidden rewards: the warm glow of feeling virtuous, the social approval of being generous, the relief of easing your own discomfort at seeing someone else suffer. Is there any act that is *purely* for the other, with zero benefit to the self?

Thomas Hobbes thought not. All human action, he argued, is ultimately self-interested. When you give money to a beggar, you're really buying relief from the unpleasant feeling their suffering causes you. What looks like generosity is just enlightened selfishness — psychological egoism dressed up in noble clothing.

But this argument has a problem. Just because an action makes you feel good doesn't mean that's *why* you did it. If you save a drowning child, the satisfaction you feel afterward is a consequence of your concern for the child, not its cause. The philosopher C. Daniel Batson has argued, based on decades of psychological research, that genuine empathy-driven altruism exists — people sometimes help because they genuinely care, not because they're buying good feelings.

Evolutionary biology complicates things further. Kin altruism — sacrificing for relatives who share your genes — makes Darwinian sense. Reciprocal altruism — helping others who will later help you — also fits. But what about helping strangers you'll never see again? Some biologists and philosophers argue this is just a "misfire" of instincts evolved for smaller groups. Others, like Peter Singer, argue that our moral circle can and should expand beyond evolutionary logic: if you can prevent suffering at little cost to yourself, you ought to, regardless of whether the sufferer shares your genes or your neighborhood.

The Buddhist tradition offers a different framework entirely. The bodhisattva — a being who postpones their own enlightenment to help all sentient beings — embodies altruism not as a sacrifice but as the natural expression of seeing through the illusion of a separate self. If the boundary between self and other is not as solid as it appears, then acting for others *is* acting for yourself, in the deepest sense.
