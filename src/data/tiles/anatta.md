Anatta — "non-self" — is the Buddhist teaching that there is no permanent, unchanging self at the core of your experience.

Look for it. Close your eyes and try to find the "you" that stays constant through all your changing thoughts, feelings, and sensations. What you'll find, Buddhism suggests, is just more thoughts, feelings, and sensations — an ever-shifting stream with no fixed center. The sense of a unified, enduring "I" isn't a discovery; it's a construction. And clinging to that construction, the Buddha taught, is one of the deepest sources of suffering.

This is a radical claim. Most philosophical traditions assume there's *something* that persists through change — Descartes found his *cogito*, Hindu philosophy locates the eternal *atman*, and common sense insists that the person who went to bed last night is the same one who woke up this morning. The Buddha rejected all of this. In the Khandha Sutta, he analyzes a human being into five aggregates (skandhas): form, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. Each of these is impermanent and constantly changing. None of them is "you." And there's nothing hiding behind them, either.

But if there's no self, who is reading this sentence? Who makes decisions? Who gets reborn? These questions have occupied Buddhist philosophers for millennia. The Theravāda tradition leans into the analysis: the "self" is a convenient label for a causal process, like calling a river "the Thames" even though the water is always different. The Madhyamaka school, through Nāgārjuna, connects anatta to the broader concept of śūnyatā (emptiness): not just selves but *all things* lack inherent, independent existence. Everything arises in dependence on everything else.

Anatta isn't meant to be depressing. It's meant to be liberating. If there's no fixed self to defend, protect, and aggrandize, then much of what makes life painful — wounded pride, anxious comparison, the terror of death as personal annihilation — loosens its grip. You're not losing something real; you're waking up from a dream of something that was never there.

The Western philosopher who came closest to this view was David Hume, who looked inward and found only "a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity." He reached the same conclusion as the Buddha by a completely different path — and seemed rather less at peace with it.
