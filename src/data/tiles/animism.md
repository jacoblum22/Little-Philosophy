Animism is the view that the world is full of persons — not all of them human. Rivers, mountains, animals, trees, and even stones may possess spirit, agency, and deserving of respect.

For most of human history, this wasn't a controversial idea. It was simply how people understood the world. Indigenous traditions across every continent describe relationships with non-human persons: the bear that gives itself to the hunter, the river that must be asked before its water is taken, the ancestors who remain present in the land. These aren't metaphors or superstitions to be outgrown. They're expressions of a fundamentally relational ontology — a way of understanding existence as a web of relationships between beings, rather than a collection of objects acted upon by subjects.

Western philosophy has mostly dismissed animism. Descartes drew a hard line between humans (who have minds) and everything else (which is mere mechanism). Animals are automata; nature is a machine. This move was enormously productive for science — if nature is just matter in motion, you can study it, predict it, and control it. But it came at a cost: it stripped the world of meaning, turning everything outside human consciousness into raw material.

Recent philosophy has begun to reconsider. The "new animism" associated with thinkers like Graham Harvey draws on anthropological work with indigenous peoples to propose animism not as a primitive belief system but as a sophisticated relational ontology. To be an animist, on this view, is to recognize that personhood isn't limited to humans — that other beings have perspectives, interests, and capacities for relationship.

This connects to broader philosophical movements. Object-oriented ontology (Graham Harman) and actor-network theory (Bruno Latour) challenge the human monopoly on agency. Environmental philosophy asks whether rights should extend beyond humans. Process philosophy (Whitehead) describes all of reality as composed of experiencing subjects, not inert objects.

Animism's deepest challenge to modern thought is this: what if the disenchantment of the world wasn't a discovery but a loss? What if treating the world as alive isn't projection but recognition?
