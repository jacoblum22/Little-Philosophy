Atheism is the position that God — or gods — does not exist. It's one of the oldest ideas in philosophy, though for most of history it's been one of the most dangerous to express.

The word comes from the Greek *atheos* — "without god." In ancient Athens, it was an accusation: Socrates was charged with atheism (though he actually seemed to believe in *something* divine — just not the city's official gods). But genuine philosophical atheism has deep roots. The ancient Indian Cārvāka school rejected all religious authority and supernatural claims, insisting that only what can be perceived by the senses is real. Democritus and Epicurus proposed materialist worldviews that left little room for divine intervention.

The modern arguments for atheism crystallized in the Enlightenment. The problem of evil — how can an all-powerful, all-knowing, perfectly good God allow terrible suffering? — has been the most persistent. Hume sharpened it to a razor's edge: the sheer quantity and distribution of suffering in the world is exactly what you'd expect if there were no benevolent designer. Earthquakes that kill children, diseases that torment the innocent, cruelty on a massive scale — none of this fits the profile of a universe run by an omnibenevolent God.

Nietzsche went further than mere disbelief. "God is dead," he declared — not as a celebration but as a diagnosis. Western civilization had been built on Christian foundations, and those foundations had crumbled. The question wasn't whether God exists but what happens to morality, meaning, and purpose once the guarantor of all three is gone. Nietzsche saw the danger: nihilism, the collapse into "nothing matters." He also saw an opportunity: if there's no God to define your values, you must create them yourself.

The 20th century added existentialist atheism (Sartre: without God, there's no human nature, and we're "condemned to be free") and scientific atheism (the universe can be explained without invoking a creator). The "new atheists" — Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris — argued that religion is not just false but actively harmful.

But atheism has its own philosophical problems. Can it ground morality? Can it account for the existence of anything at all? Does it do justice to the depth of religious experience? These aren't devastating objections — but they're genuine questions that thoughtful atheists continue to wrestle with.
