Atman is the Hindu concept of the true self — the eternal, unchanging essence that lies beneath your thoughts, emotions, body, and personality.

In the Upanishads, the idea unfolds dramatically. The sage Yajnavalkya teaches that Atman is not the body, not the mind, not the senses — it can only be described by negation: "neti, neti" — "not this, not this." Everything you can point to and say "that's me" isn't really you. The real you is the witness behind all experience, the consciousness that watches thoughts arise and fade without being any of them.

The most stunning claim comes in the Chandogya Upanishad's famous teaching: "Tat tvam asi" — "That art thou." Your Atman isn't just a personal soul; it's identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality of the universe. The drop of water is the ocean. The individual self is the cosmic self. This is the foundation of Advaita Vedanta, and it amounts to saying that the separation between you and everything else is an illusion.

Buddhism directly challenges this idea. The Buddha taught anatta (no-self) — the doctrine that there is no permanent, unchanging Atman. What we call the "self" is just a bundle of constantly changing processes. This disagreement between Hinduism and Buddhism — whether there is or isn't a true self — is one of the deepest fault lines in Asian philosophy. Both traditions agree that ordinary self-identification is mistaken; they disagree about what's left when the illusion falls away.
