Authority is the right to command, decide, or be believed — power that is considered legitimate, not merely imposed by force.

The distinction between authority and mere power is central to political philosophy. A mugger has power over you; a police officer has authority. What's the difference? Max Weber identified three sources of legitimate authority: traditional ("we've always done it this way"), charismatic (the personal magnetism of a leader), and rational-legal (the impersonal rule of law and bureaucracy). Modern democracies are supposed to rest on the third, but all three continue to operate.

The deepest question is where authority comes from. The divine right of kings held that political authority descended from God — the monarch rules because God wills it. Social contract theorists (Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau) rejected this: authority comes from the consent of the governed. People agree (explicitly or tacitly) to submit to authority in exchange for security, order, and the protection of rights. Without consent, authority collapses into tyranny.

But consent can be manufactured. Foucault showed how authority operates through institutions (schools, hospitals, prisons) that shape what people think and desire, making obedience feel natural rather than coerced. Gramsci called this "hegemony" — the ruling class maintains authority not primarily through force but through cultural domination, by making its worldview seem like common sense.

Anarchist thinkers challenge the concept entirely. Bakunin, Kropotkin, and others argued that no authority is inherently legitimate — every instance of authority bears the burden of justifying itself, and most fail. Noam Chomsky adopted this as a general principle: authority should always be questioned, and any authority that cannot justify itself should be dismantled.
