Becoming is the process of change — the idea that reality isn't a collection of fixed things but a ceaseless flow of transformation.

Is the world fundamentally static or dynamic? This is one of the oldest questions in philosophy, and it splits thinkers into two camps. On one side stands Parmenides, who argued that true Being is unchanging — change is an illusion, a trick of the senses. On the other stands Heraclitus, who declared that everything is in flux, that you can never step in the same river twice because both the river and you have changed.

Most of us live as though both are true. Your coffee cup seems like the same object it was five minutes ago — but the atoms that compose it are vibrating, and it's slowly cooling. You seem like the same person you were last year — but your cells, memories, beliefs, and relationships have all shifted. The philosophical concept of "becoming" takes Heraclitus's side seriously: what if the process is more real than the product? What if change isn't something that happens to things, but what things actually are?

Process philosophy, developed by Alfred North Whitehead, builds an entire metaphysics on this idea: reality is composed not of substances but of events, processes, patterns of becoming. In Chinese philosophy, the concept of change (yi) is similarly fundamental — the I Ching (Book of Changes) takes transformation as the deepest principle of reality. And in Nietzsche's thought, becoming triumphs over being: there is no fixed truth, no permanent self, only the endless creative destruction of life.
