A belief is something you hold to be true — a mental commitment to the way you think the world is, whether you can prove it or not.

We run on beliefs. You believe the floor is solid, that the sun will rise, that other people have minds. Most of these beliefs operate in the background, unexamined, shaping your behavior without you ever consciously choosing them. But philosophy asks uncomfortable questions: which of your beliefs are actually justified? How many are true? And what's the difference between a belief, an opinion, a conviction, and faith?

Epistemologists have traditionally defined knowledge as "justified true belief" — meaning that to know something, you must believe it, it must be true, and you must have good reasons for believing it. This tidy definition survived for thousands of years until Edmund Gettier published a three-page paper in 1963 showing that you could meet all three conditions and still not have knowledge. (Imagine believing your coworker is in the office because you see someone at their desk — and they are in the office, but the person you saw was someone else.) The question of what turns belief into knowledge is still unresolved.

Different traditions handle belief differently. Western philosophy tends to treat belief as an individual cognitive state — something happening inside one person's head. But in many traditions, beliefs are communal: you believe what your tradition, your elders, or your sacred texts tell you. The Islamic concept of iman, the Hindu notion of shraddha, and the Christian understanding of faith all involve belief that goes beyond evidence — trust in something that can't be fully proven. Whether this kind of belief is a virtue or a vulnerability depends on whom you ask.
