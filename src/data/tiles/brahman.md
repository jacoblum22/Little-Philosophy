Brahman is the ultimate reality in Hindu philosophy — the infinite, formless ground of all existence, from which everything arises and into which everything returns.

Imagine everything that exists: every star, every thought, every grain of sand, every moment of joy and suffering. Now imagine what underlies all of it — not another thing among things, but the *being* of being itself, the awareness within awareness, the reality that remains when every particular form is stripped away. That, according to the Upanishads, is Brahman.

Brahman is notoriously difficult to describe, because description works by distinguishing one thing from another, and Brahman is not a thing among other things. The great Upanishadic formula is *neti neti* — "not this, not that." Brahman is not the sky, not the earth, not the mind, not any object of experience — and yet it is the reality in which all of these appear. The positive description, when one is attempted, is *sat-cit-ānanda*: being, consciousness, and bliss — not three properties but three aspects of a single indivisible reality.

The most revolutionary claim of the Upanishads is the identity of Brahman (the ultimate cosmic reality) with Ātman (the innermost self). "Tat tvam asi" — "You are that." The deepest layer of your own consciousness is not separate from the ground of all reality. Ignorance (*avidyā*) is thinking you are a separate, limited individual; liberation (*mokṣa*) is realizing that your true nature was always Brahman.

Śaṅkara, the great 8th-century philosopher of Advaita (non-dual) Vedānta, made this identity absolute. The world of multiplicity — of separate objects, separate selves, of you and me as distinct beings — is *māyā*, a kind of cosmic illusion projected onto the one undivided Brahman. There is ultimately only one reality, and it is pure consciousness.

Other Hindu schools disagreed. Rāmānuja's Viśiṣṭādvaita ("qualified non-dualism") argued that individual souls and the material world are real — they're aspects of Brahman, not illusions. Madhva's Dvaita ("dualism") insisted that Brahman (identified with God, Viṣṇu) and individual souls are genuinely distinct. The debate about whether ultimate reality is one or many runs through Indian philosophy like a river.

What makes Brahman philosophically powerful — whether you accept the metaphysics or not — is the question it forces: is there something beneath the surface of things, some reality more fundamental than what appears? And if so, could you be more intimately connected to it than you ever imagined?
