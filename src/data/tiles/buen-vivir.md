Buen Vivir — "good living" or "living well" — is a philosophy rooted in Indigenous Andean traditions that defines the good life not as material accumulation but as harmony between people, communities, and the natural world.

Unlike the Western notion of progress, which tends to measure well-being in economic terms (GDP, income, consumption), Buen Vivir measures it by the quality of relationships — with family, with community, with the land, with the water, with the ancestors. In this framework, you can be wealthy by economic standards and living badly, if your wealth comes at the cost of community bonds or ecological destruction.

The concept has roots in the Quechua notion of Sumak Kawsay and the Aymara Suma Qamaña. Both describe a way of life centered on reciprocity, communal well-being, and respect for Pachamama (Mother Earth). These aren't abstract philosophical principles — they're lived practices embedded in daily life, agriculture, and governance for thousands of years.

What makes Buen Vivir philosophically significant is that it offers a genuine alternative to the dominant Western framework for thinking about the good life. It challenges the individualism of both liberalism and existentialism, the anthropocentrism of most Western ethics, and the assumption that more is always better. Ecuador and Bolivia both incorporated Buen Vivir into their constitutions in the late 2000s — a rare case of an Indigenous philosophical concept becoming constitutional law.
