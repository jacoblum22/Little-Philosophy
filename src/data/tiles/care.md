Care is the basic orientation of a being that is invested in the world — that things matter to it, that it can be affected, that it is not indifferent.

You might think of care as a feeling — something warm and gentle, like caring for a friend. But philosophically, care runs much deeper. It's the condition that makes feelings possible in the first place. A rock can't be disappointed. A thermostat can't worry. You can, because you *care* — about your life, your relationships, your projects, your future. Care is what gives the world its grip on you.

Heidegger made care (*Sorge*) the fundamental structure of human existence in *Being and Time*. To be human, he argued, is to be "ahead of yourself" — always already concerned with what's coming, what needs doing, what matters. You're thrown into a world you didn't choose, surrounded by things and people that demand your involvement, and projecting yourself toward possibilities that haven't yet arrived. Care is the name for this whole structure of involvement. It's not something you add to existence; it *is* existence, as experienced from the inside.

In the 1980s, Carol Gilligan and Nel Noddings developed what became known as the "ethics of care" — a feminist challenge to the dominant tradition of abstract moral principles. Where Kantian ethics asks "what rule should everyone follow?" and utilitarianism asks "what produces the most good?," care ethics asks "what does this particular relationship require of me?" Morality isn't primarily about impartial rules; it's about responsiveness to real people in real situations. A mother caring for a sick child doesn't consult the categorical imperative — she responds to what her child needs, right now.

This doesn't mean care ethics is anti-intellectual or merely sentimental. Joan Tronto expanded the framework politically, arguing that care is essential to democratic citizenship: who gives care, who receives it, and who is responsible for it are deeply political questions. Societies that undervalue care work — overwhelmingly performed by women and marginalized people — are not just economically unjust but morally confused about what human life actually requires.

At its core, care reminds philosophy of something it sometimes forgets: before we are thinkers, we are beings who are affected, involved, and vulnerable. And that vulnerability isn't a weakness to overcome — it's the ground of everything that makes life meaningful.
