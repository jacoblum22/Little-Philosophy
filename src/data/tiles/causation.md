Causation is the relationship between events where one brings about the other — the "because" that connects what happens to why it happens.

It seems obvious: the ball broke the window because it hit it. But David Hume showed that this obviousness is an illusion. When you look carefully, all you actually observe is one event (the ball flying) followed by another event (the glass shattering). You don't observe the "because" — the necessary connection between them. What you call causation, Hume argued, is really just a habit of expectation built from repeated experience. You've seen balls break windows before, so you expect it to happen again. But expectation is in your mind, not in the world.

This was philosophically devastating. If Hume is right, then science — which is built on causal explanations — rests on a foundation it can't prove. Kant tried to rescue causation by arguing it's a necessary structure of human understanding: we can't experience the world at all without organizing it causally, even if we can't prove the world itself is causal. But that doesn't quite dispel the worry.

Aristotle had a much richer view. He identified four types of cause: the material cause (what something is made of), the formal cause (its structure or design), the efficient cause (what set it in motion), and the final cause (its purpose or aim). Modern science retained only the efficient cause and dropped the rest — but some philosophers argue this was a mistake, especially the loss of final causation, which gave the world its sense of purpose and meaning.

Buddhist philosophy offers yet another perspective with dependent origination (pratityasamutpada): everything arises in dependence on conditions. There are no isolated causes and no first cause — just an interconnected web of conditions mutually supporting each other. This challenges both the Western linear model of causation and the religious idea of an uncaused creator.
