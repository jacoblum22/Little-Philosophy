Certainty is the state of knowing something beyond any possibility of doubt — or at least, the belief that you do.

Descartes made certainty the foundation of his entire philosophical project. Sitting by his fire in his dressing gown, he decided to doubt everything that could possibly be doubted — the senses (which sometimes deceive), mathematics (which an evil demon might manipulate), even the existence of the physical world. What survived the doubt? Only the fact that he was doubting: "I think, therefore I am." From this single certainty, he tried to rebuild all of knowledge. The project was magnificent and, most philosophers would say, a failure — he couldn't get from the certainty of his own existence to certainty about anything else without smuggling in assumptions.

The history of epistemology since Descartes has been largely a retreat from certainty. Hume showed that we can't be certain about causation. Kant showed that we can't be certain about things-in-themselves. Gödel showed that even mathematics can't be certain about its own consistency. The pragmatists argued that certainty is the wrong goal entirely — what matters is not whether a belief is beyond doubt but whether it works, whether it helps us navigate the world.

Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his final work "On Certainty," offered a different take: some things function as certainties not because we've proven them but because they form the bedrock on which proof itself rests. You can't prove that the physical world exists, but you can't doubt it coherently either — the doubt itself presupposes a world in which doubting occurs.

The question of certainty has practical weight. How certain must you be to act? To convict someone? To believe in God? Perfect certainty may be unattainable, but the demand for it can't be entirely abandoned without losing the distinction between knowledge and wishful thinking.
