Change is the transformation of one state into another — the fact that nothing in the universe stays exactly as it is.

Is change real, or is it an illusion? This question divided ancient Greek philosophy. Heraclitus insisted that everything is in constant flux — stability is the illusion. Parmenides argued the opposite: genuine change is logically impossible, because something cannot come from nothing. Zeno's paradoxes tried to prove Parmenides right by showing that even motion — the simplest form of change — leads to contradictions.

Most philosophical traditions accept that change is real and try to understand it. The I Ching, one of the oldest texts in Chinese philosophy, takes change as the fundamental principle of reality and provides a framework for understanding its patterns. In Hindu and Buddhist thought, impermanence (anicca) is one of the basic marks of existence — everything that arises will pass away. The philosophical question shifts from "is change real?" to "what is the pattern within the change?" and "how should we relate to it?"

In the modern era, thinkers like Hegel and Marx made change the engine of history itself. Hegel saw history as a dialectical process — thesis, antithesis, synthesis — in which contradictions drive transformation toward greater complexity and freedom. Marx applied this to economics and politics, arguing that class struggle drives historical change. Even Thomas Kuhn's philosophy of science describes knowledge advancing not smoothly but through revolutionary paradigm shifts. The question of change is ultimately about time, identity, and reality: if everything is changing, what (if anything) stays the same?
