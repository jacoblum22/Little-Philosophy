Character is the relatively stable pattern of dispositions that defines how a person tends to think, feel, and act — the kind of person you are when no one is watching.

For Aristotle, character (ethos) was the central concern of ethics. He argued that virtues are not abstract rules but settled dispositions of character developed through practice. You become courageous by performing courageous acts, honest by telling the truth repeatedly, generous by giving. Character is like a muscle: it grows through exercise and atrophies through neglect. This is why Aristotle placed such emphasis on education and habit — by the time you're reasoning about ethics, your character is already largely formed.

Confucian philosophy shares this focus. The concept of the junzi — the "exemplary person" or "gentleman" — describes someone whose character has been refined through study, ritual practice, and self-cultivation. Confucius taught that moral development is not primarily about learning rules but about shaping yourself into the kind of person who naturally does what is right. The goal is ren (humaneness or benevolence), a quality of character that manifests in every relationship and interaction.

Modern psychology has complicated the philosophical picture. Situationist research suggests that behavior is determined more by circumstances than by character traits. In famous experiments, people who had just found a dime were dramatically more likely to help a stranger than those who hadn't. If a dime can override your "character," how stable are your dispositions really? This challenge has forced virtue ethicists to clarify what they mean: not that good people always act well regardless of circumstances, but that cultivating character increases the probability and improves the quality of your moral responses.

The question remains: is character something you discover in yourself, or something you build? Are some people born with better moral material, or is everyone equally capable of becoming virtuous?
