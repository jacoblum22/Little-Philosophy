Citizenship is the bond — of rights, duties, and belonging — between an individual and a political community. It answers the question: who counts as a member?

The concept was born in the ancient Greek *polis*. To be a citizen of Athens was to participate directly in governing — debating policy in the Assembly, serving on juries, holding public office by lottery. But Athenian citizenship was radically exclusive: women, slaves, and resident foreigners (*metics*) were all excluded. Full citizenship applied to perhaps 10-15% of the population. The brilliance and the brutality were inseparable.

Roman citizenship expanded the concept. By granting citizenship to conquered peoples across a vast empire, Rome showed that citizenship didn't require ethnic or cultural homogeneity. "Civis Romanus sum" ("I am a Roman citizen") was a claim to legal protection and rights regardless of where you were born. Paul of Tarsus invoked his Roman citizenship to avoid being flogged without trial.

Modern citizenship is shaped by the revolutions of the 18th century. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (1789) linked citizenship to universal rights. But the universalism was immediately contested: Olympe de Gouges pointed out that the "Rights of Man" literally meant men. The expansion of citizenship — to non-property-owners, to women, to formerly enslaved people, to Indigenous peoples — has been the central political struggle of the modern era, and it's not over.

The philosopher Hannah Arendt identified what she called "the right to have rights" — the idea that citizenship itself is the most fundamental right, because without belonging to a political community, all other rights are unenforceable. Stateless people, she argued, are the most vulnerable humans precisely because no state recognizes them as members.

The tension at the heart of citizenship is between inclusion and exclusion. Every community that says "you belong" is simultaneously saying to someone else "you don't."
