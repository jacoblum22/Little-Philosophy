Civic virtue is the set of character traits — public-spiritedness, willingness to sacrifice private interest for the common good, active participation in governance — that makes self-government possible.

Democracy doesn't run on institutions alone. It needs citizens who show up, who care about more than their own advantage, who are willing to compromise, to serve, and to put the public good ahead of personal gain. Civic virtue is the name for this disposition — and the worry that it's disappearing is as old as democracy itself.

The ancient republicans — Aristotle, Cicero, the patricians of the Roman Republic — believed that political participation was central to the good life. To be a citizen wasn't just to have rights; it was to bear responsibilities. The *virtus* of a Roman citizen meant manliness, courage, and willingness to serve the republic. When citizens became lazy, corrupt, or focused solely on private pleasures, the republic fell.

Machiavelli revived this tradition in the Renaissance, arguing in the *Discourses on Livy* that a republic's health depends on the *virtù* of its citizens. Virtù is not Christian virtue but political energy — the vigor, boldness, and public commitment that prevents a republic from sliding into tyranny or corruption.

Rousseau made civic virtue the centerpiece of his political philosophy. A good republic requires citizens who identify with the general will, who see their own good as inseparable from the common good. This is demanding — it requires moral formation, not just legal protection.

Liberal critics worry that this tradition is too demanding and potentially authoritarian. If the state requires citizens to be virtuous, who decides what virtue looks like? Isaiah Berlin argued for negative liberty — freedom *from* interference — precisely because positive projects of civic formation tend to slide into coercion.

The question remains: can a democracy survive on self-interest alone, or does it need citizens who genuinely care about the public good?
