Civil disobedience is the deliberate, public, nonviolent breaking of a law you believe is unjust — and the willingness to accept the legal consequences.

That last part matters. Civil disobedience isn't just breaking the law; criminals do that. It's breaking the law *openly*, as a moral statement, while respecting the broader rule of law enough to accept punishment. The point isn't to escape the system — it's to expose its injustice so compellingly that the system has to change.

Henry David Thoreau gave the concept its name in 1849, after spending a night in jail for refusing to pay a tax that supported slavery and the Mexican-American War. His essay "Civil Disobedience" argued that when a government requires you to be "the agent of injustice to another," you have not just the right but the duty to resist. Conscience, not law, is the highest authority.

But it was Mahatma Gandhi who turned civil disobedience into a mass political strategy. His concept of *satyagraha* — "truth-force" or "soul-force" — transformed individual moral protest into collective action. The Salt March of 1930, in which tens of thousands of Indians peacefully broke the British salt monopoly, showed that nonviolent resistance could challenge an empire. Gandhi understood something crucial: civil disobedience works not through force but through moral persuasion. When the powerful beat, jail, and kill people who refuse to fight back, the injustice becomes impossible to ignore.

Martin Luther King Jr. brought this tradition to the American civil rights movement. In his *Letter from Birmingham Jail*, he answered critics who called his protests "untimely" and "illegal" by drawing on Augustine and Aquinas: an unjust law is no law at all. King distinguished between just laws (which align with the moral law and uplift human dignity) and unjust laws (which degrade it). Obeying an unjust law without protest, he argued, is cooperating in your own oppression.

Philosophers continue to debate the boundaries. John Rawls accepted civil disobedience as legitimate in a "nearly just" society — but what about deeply unjust ones? Does civil disobedience have to be nonviolent to count? Does it have to accept punishment? And in a democracy, why not just vote for change? The answer, civil disobedience advocates insist, is that some injustices are too urgent to wait for, and some majorities too entrenched to persuade through normal channels.
