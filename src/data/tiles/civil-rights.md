Civil rights are the legal guarantees that protect individuals from being treated unequally by their government or by other citizens — the rights to vote, to equal treatment under law, to freedom of expression, assembly, and religion. They're the practical machinery through which abstract ideas about equality become lived reality.

The concept has roots in ancient Rome, where *civitas* (citizenship) granted specific legal protections. But the modern civil rights tradition was forged in struggle. The French Declaration of the Rights of Man (1789) and the American Bill of Rights (1791) established the principle that governments exist to protect individual freedoms. Yet both documents coexisted comfortably with slavery, colonialism, and the denial of rights to women — revealing the gap between declared principles and actual practice that has driven civil rights movements ever since.

The American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and countless others, became a template for nonviolent resistance to systemic injustice worldwide. King's *Letter from Birmingham Jail* articulated why those denied their rights cannot simply wait for the majority to grant them: "Justice too long delayed is justice denied." The movement drew on Christian theology, Gandhian nonviolence, and natural law theory to argue that unjust laws are "no law at all" (echoing Aquinas).

Civil rights struggles continue globally — for racial equality, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, disability rights, indigenous rights. Each movement forces the same philosophical question: are these rights discovered (inherent in human nature) or invented (created by political struggle)? The answer matters, because if rights are discovered, denying them is an error; if invented, they're always vulnerable to being uninvented by those with enough power.
