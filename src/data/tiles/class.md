Class is the division of society into groups based on their economic position — who owns what, who works for whom, and who benefits from the arrangement. It's one of the most powerful lenses for understanding why societies are structured the way they are.

Marx made class the central concept of his entire philosophy. He identified two fundamental classes in capitalist society: the bourgeoisie (who own the means of production — factories, land, capital) and the proletariat (who own only their labor and must sell it to survive). The relationship between them is inherently exploitative: the worker produces more value than they're paid for, and the surplus goes to the owner as profit. Class struggle — the conflict between these groups over the distribution of wealth and power — is, for Marx, the engine of historical change.

But class is more than economics. Pierre Bourdieu showed how class reproduces itself through culture: upper-class families pass on not just money but "cultural capital" — the tastes, habits, manners, and knowledge that signal belonging to a particular social position. A working-class student at an elite university may have the grades but still feel out of place, because the institution's unwritten codes weren't designed for them.

Max Weber complicated Marx's picture by arguing that class (economic position) is only one dimension of social stratification, alongside status (social prestige) and party (political power). You can be wealthy but socially marginal, or socially esteemed but poor. The philosophical question class raises is whether inequality is natural and inevitable, a necessary incentive for productivity, or a structural injustice that can and should be overcome.
