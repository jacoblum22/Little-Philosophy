Colonialism is the practice of dominating another people — taking their land, resources, labor, and often their identity — and the philosophical traditions that justified it.

Between the 15th and 20th centuries, European powers colonized most of the world. But colonialism wasn't just a military and economic project. It was a philosophical one. It required a worldview in which some peoples were civilized and others were not, some cultures were advanced and others were primitive, some races were rational and others were childlike. These weren't just prejudices — they were elaborated into philosophical systems by thinkers from Hegel (who placed Africa outside the movement of world history) to Mill (who argued that "barbarian" peoples were not ready for self-government).

Frantz Fanon, a psychiatrist from Martinique who joined the Algerian independence movement, produced the most devastating philosophical analysis of colonialism's psychological effects. In *Black Skin, White Masks* and *The Wretched of the Earth*, Fanon showed how colonialism doesn't just exploit the colonized — it reshapes their consciousness. The colonized person internalizes the colonizer's values, learning to see their own culture as inferior, their own body as wrong, their own language as shameful. Liberation requires not just political independence but psychological decolonization.

Edward Said's *Orientalism* examined how Western scholarship constructed the "Orient" as exotic, irrational, and inferior — a mirror image against which the West could define itself as rational, progressive, and superior. Knowledge production itself, Said argued, is entangled with power.

Gayatri Spivak asked the philosophical question: can the subaltern speak? Can the colonized subject represent themselves in a framework built by the colonizer, or does the very language of rights, justice, and humanity carry colonial assumptions?

Postcolonial philosophy doesn't just add non-Western voices to an existing conversation. It questions whether the conversation itself — its categories, its assumptions, its definitions of "philosophy" — was structured by colonial power from the beginning.
