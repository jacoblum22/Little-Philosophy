Comedy is the art of making people laugh — but philosophically, the interesting question is *why* we laugh, and what comedy reveals about the human condition.

Three major theories of humor have competed for centuries. The **superiority theory**, stretching from Plato and Aristotle through Hobbes, holds that we laugh when we feel superior to others — at their mistakes, misfortunes, or foolishness. Hobbes called laughter a "sudden glory" arising from the perception of our own advantage. The **incongruity theory**, championed by Kant and Schopenhauer, says humor arises from a mismatch between expectation and reality — a punchline works because it violates the pattern your mind was building. The **relief theory**, associated with Freud, views laughter as the release of nervous energy — comedy lets us discharge tension around taboo subjects like sex, death, and aggression.

Comedy has always had a subversive edge. Aristophanes used comedy to mock Athenian politicians and even Socrates himself. Carnival traditions across cultures create temporary inversions of social order — the fool becomes king, the sacred becomes profane. Mikhail Bakhtin saw this "carnivalesque" laughter as genuinely liberating: it challenges authority by refusing to take it seriously.

But comedy also raises ethical questions. When does humor cross the line from liberation to cruelty? Laughing at the powerful is different from laughing at the vulnerable. Henri Bergson argued that comedy serves a social function — we laugh at rigidity, at people who behave mechanically rather than flexibly — and this laughter is a corrective force, shaming people back into social harmony. Whether that correction is healthy or conformist depends on who's laughing and who's being laughed at.
