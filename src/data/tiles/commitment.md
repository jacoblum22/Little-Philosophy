Commitment is the decision to bind yourself to something — a person, a cause, a belief, a practice — and to sustain that bond through difficulty, doubt, and the passage of time.

Kierkegaard placed commitment at the center of the existential life. His three stages of existence — the aesthetic (living for pleasure), the ethical (living by duty), and the religious (living by faith) — each require a deeper level of commitment. The aesthetic person avoids commitment, sampling experiences without attachment. The ethical person commits to moral principles and social roles. The religious person commits to God in a "leap of faith" that transcends both pleasure and duty. For Kierkegaard, becoming a self is impossible without commitment: you are what you commit to.

The paradox of commitment is that it restricts freedom in order to make freedom meaningful. A person who refuses to commit to anything — keeping all options perpetually open — ends up unable to do anything deeply. The pianist who commits to ten thousand hours of practice loses the freedom to spend that time on other things but gains the freedom to play Chopin. The person who commits to a marriage loses certain freedoms but gains access to a depth of relationship that casual encounters can never reach.

In Buddhist ethics, commitment takes the form of the bodhisattva vow: the aspiration to achieve enlightenment not for yourself alone but for all sentient beings. This is a commitment of staggering scope — you bind yourself to a task that spans countless lifetimes. Yet the vow is considered liberating rather than constraining, because it aligns your will with the deepest truth about reality.

The question is whether commitment must be permanent to be genuine. Can you commit "for now"? Can you commit knowing you might change your mind? Or does real commitment require the willingness to persist even when you no longer feel like it?
