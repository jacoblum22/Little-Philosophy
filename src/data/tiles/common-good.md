The common good is whatever benefits the community as a whole — the shared conditions and resources that enable all members to flourish, not just the privileged few.

Aristotle argued that politics exists for the common good: the polis is not merely a security arrangement but a community aimed at the good life for all its members. A government that serves only the rulers' interests is a corruption (tyranny, oligarchy); a government that serves the common good is legitimate. Aquinas developed this in a Christian framework: the common good is part of the natural law, and political authority is justified only insofar as it serves it.

But what counts as the "common" good? The liberal tradition (Locke, Mill, Rawls) tends to define it minimally: the common good is a set of conditions (security, liberty, basic welfare) that allow individuals to pursue their own private visions of the good life. The communitarian tradition (MacIntyre, Sandel, Taylor) argues this is too thin — a genuine common good requires shared values, shared practices, and a thick sense of community identity. Without these, "society" is just a collection of strangers cooperating out of enlightened self-interest.

The tragedy of the commons illustrates the philosophical problem in economic terms: when a shared resource (a pasture, a fishery, the atmosphere) is open to all, each individual's rational self-interest leads to overuse that destroys the resource for everyone. The common good and individual good can diverge sharply, and there's no guarantee that individual rationality will produce collective well-being.

The question is deeply relevant today. Climate change is the ultimate common-good problem: the atmosphere is a shared resource being degraded by individual and national self-interest. Solving it requires either extraordinary cooperation or some authority that can enforce the common good over private interest — which raises all the questions about power, consent, and legitimacy that political philosophy has been asking for millennia.
