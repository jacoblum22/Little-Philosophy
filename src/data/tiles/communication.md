Communication is the attempt to share experience with another being. It's what happens when the other and experience meet — the drive to bridge the gap between one mind and another.

But can we ever truly communicate what we experience? Language is our primary tool, yet it has limits. The word "red" points to a color, but does your "red" look the same as mine? Philosophers of language have spent centuries exploring this gap between what we mean and what we manage to say. Wittgenstein argued that much of philosophy is just confusion caused by the imprecision of language.
