Community is a group of people bound together not just by proximity but by shared meaning — common values, mutual obligations, and a sense of belonging that goes beyond individual self-interest.

A community is more than a crowd. Crowds share a location; communities share a life. What makes the difference? Philosophers have offered various answers: shared traditions, mutual recognition, a common purpose, overlapping networks of care. Ferdinand Tönnies drew a famous distinction between Gemeinschaft (genuine community, based on personal bonds) and Gesellschaft (association, based on contracts and self-interest). Modern life, he argued, increasingly replaces the former with the latter.

The African philosophical concept of Ubuntu — "I am because we are" — offers perhaps the most vivid expression of community as a philosophical idea. In the Ubuntu framework, a person's identity and moral integrity are constituted by their relationships. You don't become a person and then join a community; the community is what makes you a person. This stands in tension with the liberal individualism dominant in Western thought, which sees the autonomous individual as prior to any social grouping.

The philosophical tension around community is between its gifts and its dangers. Community provides meaning, belonging, and mutual support. But it can also demand conformity, exclude outsiders, and crush dissent. How do you build communities that nurture individuals without absorbing them? How do you protect individual rights without dissolving the bonds that give life meaning? These questions sit at the heart of political philosophy, and no tradition has solved them perfectly.
