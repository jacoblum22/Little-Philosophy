Community is what forms when the bonds between individuals become deeper than the structures of society — when people share not just rules and institutions, but genuine connection, belonging, and mutual care.

Philosophers have often distinguished between society (the formal structure) and community (the felt bonds). Ferdinand Tönnies drew a famous line between Gesellschaft (society — impersonal, contractual) and Gemeinschaft (community — personal, organic). Many traditions emphasize community as essential to human flourishing: Ubuntu in African philosophy teaches that "I am because we are," and Confucianism places community relationships at the center of a good life.
