Compassion is empathy turned inward and then outward — it's not just understanding another's pain, but feeling moved to do something about it. When the self meets empathy, compassion is born.

In Buddhist philosophy, compassion (karuna) is one of the highest virtues — the wish that all beings be free from suffering. In Western philosophy, Schopenhauer argued that compassion is the only genuine moral motivation, because it's the one time we truly break through the illusion of separateness. It's the difference between knowing someone is hurting and actually caring enough to act.
