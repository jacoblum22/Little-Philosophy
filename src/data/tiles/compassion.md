Compassion is the felt response to another's suffering combined with the desire to help — not just feeling someone's pain, but being moved to do something about it.

Compassion goes beyond empathy. Empathy is the ability to feel what another person feels; compassion adds a direction — toward action, toward relief. You might empathize with someone's grief and feel sad yourself. Compassion is what makes you stay, offer comfort, or take concrete steps to reduce their suffering. It's empathy with its sleeves rolled up.

Nearly every moral tradition places compassion near the center of the good life. In Buddhism, karuna (compassion) is one of the four "divine abodes" — boundless states the mind can cultivate. The Bodhisattva ideal takes this to its extreme: a being who postpones their own enlightenment to help all sentient beings escape suffering. In Christianity, the compassion of Christ — moved by the suffering of others to heal, feed, and forgive — is the model for moral action. In Islam, every chapter of the Quran opens with "In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful."

But is compassion always a virtue? Some thinkers worry that compassion is too selective — we feel it more intensely for people close to us, people who look like us, or people whose suffering is visible and dramatic. Nietzsche went further, arguing that compassion can actually be a form of weakness — a way of diminishing the strong rather than genuinely helping the weak. These criticisms don't disprove compassion, but they sharpen the question: how do you extend compassion beyond your immediate circle to include strangers, enemies, and beings whose suffering you'll never witness?
