Conscience is that inner voice that tells you when something is right or wrong — the feeling of moral discomfort that arises when you're about to do, or have done, something you sense you shouldn't.

But where does conscience come from? Is it the voice of God, as many religious traditions claim? A product of evolution, wired into us for social survival? The internalized expectations of your parents and culture? Or something more — a genuine faculty for perceiving moral truth, the way your eyes perceive light?

Socrates spoke of a daimonion — an inner spirit that warned him when he was about to make a mistake. The Stoics believed conscience was an expression of universal reason operating within each person. In the Christian tradition, Thomas Aquinas described conscience as the application of moral knowledge to particular situations — not infallible, but a necessary guide. Kant went further: he argued that reason alone, without any external authority, can determine what morality requires. The moral law isn't imposed from outside — it's something you legislate for yourself through rational reflection.

The most troubling question about conscience is what happens when it fails. History is full of people who committed terrible acts with a clear conscience, and others who felt agonizing guilt over things they couldn't control. If conscience can be wrong, how do you distinguish genuine moral insight from mere cultural conditioning? This question becomes especially urgent when your conscience tells you something different from what your society demands.
