Conscience is your inner sense of right and wrong — the feeling that arises when the self reflects on its own actions and asks: was that good? Should I have done that differently? It's reflection with a moral dimension.

Where does conscience come from? Is it an innate moral faculty, planted in us by nature or God? Or is it shaped by upbringing, culture, and experience? Kant believed conscience reflects a universal moral law that rational beings can discover through reason. The Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, like Francis Hutcheson, argued for a "moral sense" — an inborn ability to feel the difference between right and wrong. Others, like Nietzsche, questioned whether conscience might be a tool of social control rather than a guide to truth.
