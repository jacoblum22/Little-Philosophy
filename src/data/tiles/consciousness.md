Consciousness is what it's like to be you — the inner experience of seeing, thinking, feeling, and being aware. It emerges when the self turns inward and reflects on its own experience.

Consciousness is sometimes called the "hard problem" of philosophy (and science). We can explain how the brain processes information, but we still can't explain why there's "something it's like" to have those processes. Why doesn't the brain just process in the dark, without any inner experience at all? This question has puzzled thinkers for centuries, and it remains one of the deepest unsolved problems in philosophy.
