Consciousness is what it's like to be you — the inner experience of seeing, thinking, feeling, and being aware that you are aware.

This is sometimes called the "hard problem" of philosophy (and science). We can explain how the brain processes information, how neurons fire, how light becomes electrical signals. But none of that explains why there's "something it's like" to have those processes. Why doesn't the brain just process in the dark, without any inner experience at all? A computer can detect red light — but does it experience redness? The difference between detecting and experiencing is the mystery of consciousness.

The problem has ancient roots. Descartes split the world into mind and matter, arguing that consciousness is fundamentally different from physical stuff. Indian philosophy arrived at a similar distinction much earlier: the Upanishads describe consciousness (cit) as one of the three aspects of ultimate reality, alongside being and bliss. Buddhist thinkers, meanwhile, analyzed consciousness not as a single thing but as a rapidly changing stream of mental events — each moment of awareness arising and passing away.

In the modern era, the debate has intensified rather than resolved. Some philosophers (the materialists) insist that consciousness must be a physical process — we just haven't figured out the details yet. Others (the dualists, the panpsychists, the idealists) argue that consciousness can't be reduced to matter, that it's something more fundamental. The question of consciousness sits at the intersection of philosophy, neuroscience, and physics — and nobody has a satisfying answer yet.
