Consent is the voluntary agreement to something — the act of saying "yes" freely, with understanding, and without coercion. In political philosophy, it is the foundation on which legitimate authority rests.

Locke argued that legitimate government requires the consent of the governed. In the state of nature, people are free and equal; they agree to form a government only to better protect their natural rights to life, liberty, and property. If the government violates those rights, consent is withdrawn and revolution is justified. This idea shaped modern democracy: government derives its authority from the people's ongoing, tacit consent to be governed.

But tacit consent is philosophically slippery. Hume pointed out the problem: most people never explicitly consent to their government. They're born into a political system, grow up within it, and obey its laws without ever being asked. Is staying and not revolting the same as consenting? If so, the concept does very little work — virtually any government that isn't actively overthrown would count as "consented to."

Rawls tried to solve this with hypothetical consent: the question isn't whether people actually agreed to the social arrangement but whether they would agree under fair conditions (behind the "veil of ignorance"). This grounds legitimacy in what rational people would consent to, not what they actually did. Critics respond that hypothetical consent isn't consent at all — it's just a philosopher's thought experiment imposed on real people.

Beyond politics, consent has become central to medical ethics (informed consent before treatment) and to contemporary discussions of sexual ethics. In each domain, the same philosophical questions arise: What counts as genuine consent? Can consent be given under conditions of unequal power? Can you consent to something you don't fully understand? The concept is essential precisely because the conditions for genuine consent are so hard to achieve.
