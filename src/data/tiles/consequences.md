Consequences are the results that follow from an action — the effects, outcomes, and repercussions that ripple outward from what you do (or fail to do).

Whether consequences are what make an action right or wrong is one of the central debates in ethics. Consequentialists say yes: an action's moral quality is determined entirely by its outcomes. If lying saves a life, the lie was right; if telling the truth causes needless suffering, the truth-telling was wrong. The most famous version, utilitarianism, says the right action is the one that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number.

Deontologists strongly disagree. Kant argued that consequences are morally irrelevant — what matters is whether the action was done from duty, according to a principle you could will to be universal. Lying is wrong even if it saves a life, because you can't universalize a principle of lying without contradiction. The virtue of this view is that it protects moral principles from being sacrificed to expediency; the cost is that it can seem rigid in the face of real-world complexity.

The concept of unintended consequences adds another layer. A well-intentioned action can produce terrible results (the road to hell is paved with good intentions), and a selfish action can accidentally benefit others (Adam Smith's invisible hand). This unpredictability is a genuine problem for consequentialism: if you can't reliably predict consequences, how can they be the basis of moral judgment?

In Hindu philosophy, the Bhagavad Gita offers a radical alternative: act according to your dharma without attachment to consequences at all. The consequences belong to the cosmos, not to you. What matters is the spirit and integrity of the action itself. This doctrine of nishkama karma (desireless action) cuts through the consequentialist-deontological debate by denying that either consequences or duty-following captures the deepest moral truth.
