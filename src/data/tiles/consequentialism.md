Consequentialism is the ethical theory that the morality of an action depends entirely on its outcomes — that the right thing to do is whatever produces the best consequences, all things considered.

Jeremy Bentham gave the most straightforward version: the right action maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain, calculated across all affected parties. He even proposed a "felicific calculus" to measure pleasure's intensity, duration, certainty, and extent. This was radically democratic: each person's pleasure counts equally, whether they're a king or a beggar. John Stuart Mill refined this by distinguishing higher pleasures (intellectual, aesthetic) from lower ones (bodily), arguing that it's "better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."

Consequentialism's great strength is its simplicity and its focus on what actually happens to people. If two policies differ only in their effects, the one that produces better outcomes is better. This seems hard to argue with. It also provides a clear framework for decision-making in public policy: cost-benefit analysis, effective altruism, and utilitarian calculations in healthcare ethics all draw on consequentialist reasoning.

But the theory faces devastating objections. It seems to permit terrible actions if they produce good outcomes: torturing one person to save five, punishing an innocent to deter crime, breaking a promise whenever breaking it produces slightly more happiness. It also demands too much: if you should always maximize good consequences, you can never justify relaxing, spending money on yourself, or prioritizing your own family over distant strangers.

Perhaps the deepest challenge is epistemic: you can't reliably predict consequences. The action that seems best might produce disaster; the action that seems harmful might produce unexpected good. Consequentialism tells you to maximize good outcomes but can't tell you how to know which outcomes your actions will actually produce. The theory gives a clear criterion of rightness but an unclear guide to action.
