A constitution is the foundational law of a political community — the rules that govern how all other rules are made, changed, and enforced. It answers the most basic political question: who holds power, and what limits constrain them?

The idea that government should be bound by fundamental law goes back to antiquity. Aristotle catalogued the constitutions of 158 Greek city-states, analyzing how different arrangements of power (monarchy, aristocracy, democracy) could succeed or degenerate. But the modern concept of a written constitution — a single document establishing the framework of government — is largely an Enlightenment invention, realized most dramatically in the American Constitution of 1787 and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.

Constitutionalism rests on a philosophical insight: power without limits becomes tyranny. Montesquieu argued for separation of powers (legislative, executive, judicial) so that "power checks power." Madison, in the *Federalist Papers*, designed a system where ambition counteracts ambition, because he believed no government of angels was forthcoming. The genius of constitutionalism is its realism: it assumes leaders will try to abuse power and designs institutions to make that as difficult as possible.

But constitutions face deep philosophical tensions. Who has the authority to interpret the constitution? How should it adapt to circumstances the framers never imagined? Originalists argue the text should be read as its authors intended; living constitutionalists argue it must evolve with the society it governs. And there's the paradox of constituent power: the people create the constitution, but the constitution creates the legal framework within which "the people" act. The chicken-and-egg problem of constitutional founding has never been fully resolved.
