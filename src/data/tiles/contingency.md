Contingency is the philosophical term for the fact that things could have been otherwise — that what exists doesn't *have* to exist, and what happened didn't *have* to happen.

You exist. But you didn't have to. Your parents might never have met. Their parents might never have met. The planet might not have formed. The universe might have been configured differently. There is nothing about the way things are that makes them *necessary* — and this absence of necessity is what philosophers call contingency.

The contrast is with *necessity*. Mathematical truths seem necessary: 2 + 2 must equal 4 in any possible world. But the fact that there are elephants, or that water freezes at 0°C, or that you were born in the year you were — these are contingent. They are facts, but they could have been different.

Medieval philosophers used contingency as an argument for God. If everything in the world is contingent — if everything *could* not exist — then there must be something *necessary* that grounds everything else, something that exists not contingently but by its own nature. This necessary being, Aquinas argued, is God.

Sartre turned contingency into an existential experience. In *Nausea*, the protagonist Roquentin is overwhelmed by the sheer *thereness* of things — a tree root, a park bench — and realizes that nothing has a reason for existing. There is no hidden plan, no purpose behind the curtain. Things just *are*, for no reason. This realization is the nausea of the title: the vertigo of confronting a world that is thoroughly contingent, thoroughly without built-in meaning.

Richard Rorty's pragmatic liberalism embraced contingency cheerfully. Our languages, our selves, our communities — all are contingent, historical creations rather than discoveries of eternal truths. And that's fine. Recognizing contingency doesn't lead to nihilism; it leads to creativity, irony, and solidarity with other contingent beings.
