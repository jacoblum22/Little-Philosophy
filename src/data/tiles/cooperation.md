Cooperation is the ability of individuals to work together toward shared goals, not because they're forced to, but because they recognize mutual benefit and care about each other's wellbeing.

Cooperation is a puzzle for philosophers. If everyone is self-interested, why would anyone cooperate? Game theorists have explored this through dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma, showing that cooperation can emerge even among self-interested agents if they interact repeatedly. But philosophers like Peter Kropotkin argued that cooperation isn't just strategic — it's natural. Mutual aid, not competition, is what has allowed species (including humans) to thrive. The question is whether cooperation requires trust, rules, or something deeper.
