Cosmology is the study of the universe as a whole — its origin, structure, nature, and fate. It sits at the intersection of physics, philosophy, and theology, asking the biggest questions there are.

Every civilization has had a cosmology. The ancient Egyptians imagined the sky as the body of the goddess Nut, arching over the Earth. Hindu cosmology describes vast cycles of creation and destruction (kalpas), each lasting billions of years, with no ultimate beginning or end. The Book of Genesis describes creation ex nihilo — God speaking the cosmos into existence from nothing. These aren't just primitive science; they're attempts to answer the question that haunts every cosmology: why does anything exist at all?

Greek philosophers transformed cosmology from mythology to philosophy. Thales proposed water as the fundamental substance; Anaximander suggested an indefinite, boundless principle (the apeiron); Democritus proposed atoms in void. Aristotle's cosmology — a finite, spherical universe with the Earth at the center, governed by eternal circular motions — dominated Western thought for nearly two thousand years.

Modern scientific cosmology began with Copernicus moving the Earth from the center and culminated in the Big Bang theory: the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago from an initial state of extraordinary density and temperature and has been expanding ever since. But the Big Bang raises the same philosophical question it was supposed to answer: what happened before it? What caused it? And is "before" even meaningful if time itself began with the Big Bang?

The fine-tuning argument notes that the fundamental constants of physics seem precisely calibrated for the existence of complex life. Theists see this as evidence of design; multiverse theorists propose that our universe is one of countless universes with different constants. Both answers are speculative, and the question of why the cosmos is habitable remains one of the deepest puzzles at the boundary of science and philosophy.
