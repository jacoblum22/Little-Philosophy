Courage is the capacity to act in the face of fear, danger, or uncertainty — to do what you believe is right even when it costs you something.

Aristotle gave courage a place of prominence as the first virtue he analyzed in the Nicomachean Ethics. For Aristotle, courage is a mean between two extremes: cowardice (too much fear) and recklessness (too little). The courageous person feels fear — that's essential — but acts rightly despite it. A person who doesn't feel fear isn't brave; they're oblivious.

But courage isn't only about physical danger. Socrates, who famously accepted his death sentence rather than stop philosophizing, demonstrated what might be called intellectual or moral courage — the willingness to follow truth wherever it leads, even when doing so earns you the hostility of those in power. Martin Luther King Jr., Malala Yousafzai, and countless unnamed dissenters throughout history exemplify a similar kind of courage: standing up for what's right when the weight of society pushes you to sit down.

The philosophical puzzle of courage involves a tension between the individual and the community. A soldier who charges into battle is courageous in one sense — but what if the war is unjust? A whistleblower who exposes institutional corruption shows courage, but at enormous personal cost. Is courage always a virtue, regardless of the cause? Or does genuine courage require not just bravery but also wisdom — the ability to judge which battles are worth fighting?
