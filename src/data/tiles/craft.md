Craft is the skilled making of things with care, attention, and accumulated know-how. Unlike mass production, which separates design from execution, craft unites thinking and doing in a single person's practiced hands.

The ancient Greeks had a word for this: *technē* — skill or art, the knowledge of how to make something well. Aristotle distinguished *technē* from theoretical knowledge (*episteme*) and practical wisdom (*phronesis*), but he respected it as a genuine form of understanding. The craftsperson knows things that can't be fully stated in words — the right pressure for shaping clay, the exact moment to remove bread from the oven. This is what Michael Polanyi later called "tacit knowledge": knowing more than you can tell.

Richard Sennett's *The Craftsman* argues that craft is fundamental to human identity. The desire to do a job well for its own sake — not for money, status, or external reward — is a basic human drive. Craftsmanship involves a dialogue between problem-solving and problem-finding, between the hand and the head. The craftsperson doesn't just follow a blueprint; they respond to the material, adjusting as they go, learning from resistance.

The Arts and Crafts movement of the nineteenth century — led by William Morris and John Ruskin — argued that industrialization had destroyed craft, and with it the worker's dignity and creativity. Marx made a similar point: alienated labor separates workers from the products of their making. Craft resists this separation. When you make something with skill and care, you put yourself into it — and that connection between maker and made is, for many philosophers, a model of what meaningful work should look like.
