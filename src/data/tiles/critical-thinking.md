Critical thinking is the disciplined habit of evaluating claims, arguments, and evidence carefully before accepting or rejecting them — thinking about thinking in order to think better.

The roots go back to Socrates, who spent his life showing Athenians that their confident beliefs couldn't survive questioning. The Socratic method — asking "What do you mean?" and "How do you know?" — is the original critical thinking exercise. Its lesson is humbling: most people hold their beliefs not because they've examined them but because they've absorbed them from their culture, family, or emotions.

Critical thinking involves several overlapping skills: identifying assumptions (including your own), recognizing logical fallacies (ad hominem, straw man, false dilemma, appeal to authority), evaluating evidence (is it reliable? relevant? sufficient?), distinguishing correlation from causation, and considering alternative explanations. Importantly, it's not the same as being critical — it's not about tearing things down but about evaluating them fairly.

Modern cognitive science has revealed how difficult genuine critical thinking is. Daniel Kahneman's research on cognitive biases shows that human reasoning is systematically distorted: we seek out information that confirms what we already believe (confirmation bias), overweight vivid examples over statistical evidence (availability bias), and anchor on irrelevant starting points. Critical thinking is, in part, the effort to counteract these built-in tendencies.

The philosophical question is whether critical thinking alone is sufficient for good judgment. Feminist philosophers and critical theorists have argued that what counts as "rational" or "critical" is itself shaped by power structures, cultural assumptions, and social position. A truly critical thinker must examine not just individual arguments but the frameworks within which arguments are made — including the framework of "critical thinking" itself.
