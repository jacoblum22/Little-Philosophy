Culture is what happens when a society builds shared ways of understanding and relating to the world — language, art, religion, customs, and values that are passed between people and across generations.

Culture shapes how we think about everything: what counts as knowledge, what is beautiful, what is right and wrong. Philosophers have debated whether cultural differences reflect genuinely different truths (cultural relativism) or whether there are universal principles beneath the surface. Herder celebrated the uniqueness of each culture, while Enlightenment thinkers sought universal reason that transcends culture. The tension between these views is still alive today.
