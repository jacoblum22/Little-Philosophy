Death is the fact that you will stop existing — and the fact that you know it.

Animals die. Humans know they're going to die. That knowledge changes everything. It shadows every plan you make, every relationship you form, every ambition you pursue. Philosophy has been trying to figure out what to do with this knowledge for as long as philosophy has existed.

The Epicurean answer is: relax. Death is nothing to us, Epicurus argued, because where death is, we are not, and where we are, death is not. You won't experience being dead — there'll be no "you" to experience anything. Fearing death is like fearing the time before you were born: irrational, because there's no subject to suffer.

The Stoics took a different approach. Don't pretend death is nothing — *use* it. Marcus Aurelius meditated on death constantly, not as morbid wallowing but as a tool for living well. Remembering that you'll die clarifies what actually matters. It strips away vanity, pettiness, and procrastination. *Memento mori* — "remember you will die" — is not a threat but an invitation to take your life seriously.

Heidegger made death central to his account of authentic existence. Most of the time, we evade death — we say "one dies" rather than "I will die," keeping it at arm's length through euphemism and distraction. But in moments of genuine confrontation with our own finitude, something shifts. Death "individualizes" — nobody can die your death for you. Accepting this, rather than fleeing it, is what makes authentic life possible.

Buddhist and Hindu traditions frame death differently. If consciousness doesn't end but transitions — through reincarnation, rebirth, or absorption into Brahman — then death is less a wall and more a doorway. The fear of death stems from attachment to this particular life, this particular self. Letting go of that attachment is a central aim of spiritual practice.

Simone de Beauvoir, watching her mother die, wrote with devastating honesty about the gap between philosophical theories of death and the brute reality of watching someone you love cease to exist. All the arguments, she suggested, are thin comfort in the face of loss. Perhaps that discomfort is itself the point — the signal that life mattered enough to grieve.
