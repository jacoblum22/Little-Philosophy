Deconstruction is Jacques Derrida's practice of reading texts so closely that their internal contradictions surface — revealing that what seems stable and unified is always more complicated than it appears.

Deconstruction is not destruction. It's not about tearing things down for the fun of it. It's about showing that every philosophical text, every system of thought, every concept that claims to be solid and self-sufficient, contains within itself the seeds of its own undoing.

Here's the basic move. Western philosophy is built on binary oppositions: speech/writing, presence/absence, nature/culture, mind/body, male/female. In each pair, one term is typically privileged over the other. Speech is considered more authentic than writing. Presence is valued over absence. Nature is more fundamental than culture. Derrida shows that these hierarchies don't hold up under scrutiny — that the subordinate term is always already at work within the privileged one.

Take speech and writing. Philosophy has traditionally treated speech as primary (it's direct, present, alive) and writing as secondary (a mere copy, absent, dead). But Derrida argues that the features supposedly unique to writing — ambiguity, deferral of meaning, the absence of the author — are equally present in speech. When you speak, your words can be misunderstood, taken out of context, separated from your intentions. The "problems" of writing are the problems of language itself. The binary collapses.

Derrida's key concept is *différance* (with an 'a') — a coined word that blends "difference" and "deferral." Meaning is never fully present at any moment; it's always produced by differences (this word means something because it's not those other words) and always deferred (you understand a sentence only when you get to the end, and even then further context can shift what it means). Meaning is a process, not a fixed point.

Critics accuse deconstruction of being nihilistic, of denying truth, of making everything relative. Derrida consistently pushed back: deconstruction isn't relativism. It's an insistence on reading carefully enough to notice what texts are actually doing — which is always more interesting and more unstable than what they claim to be doing.
