Democracy is the idea that the people who are governed should have a say in how they're governed — that political power ultimately belongs to the many, not the few.

It sounds obvious now. It wasn't for most of history. Kings, emperors, priests, and aristocrats ruled because they claimed special authority — divine right, noble blood, superior wisdom. Democracy's radical premise is that no one has a natural right to rule over others, and that legitimate authority must flow from the consent of the governed.

The Athenians invented the word and the practice — *demos* (people) + *kratos* (power, rule). But Athenian democracy was direct: citizens debated and voted on laws themselves, without representatives. It was also sharply limited — women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded. And its greatest philosophers were skeptical of it. Plato, watching democracy condemn Socrates to death, concluded that rule by the ignorant many was worse than rule by the wise few. His *Republic* is an extended argument for philosopher-kings.

Aristotle was more measured. Democracy can degenerate into mob rule, he acknowledged, but mixed constitutions that balance democratic, aristocratic, and monarchic elements can be stable and just. This pragmatic insight influenced Roman republicanism and, eventually, modern constitutional democracy.

The modern reinvention came through social contract theory. Locke argued that government exists to protect natural rights, and that the people can revoke their consent when it fails. Rousseau went further: genuine democracy requires citizens to participate in forming the "general will" — not just voting for representatives but actively deliberating about the common good. The American and French revolutions turned these ideas into political reality, however imperfectly.

Contemporary debates remain fierce. Is representative democracy enough, or do we need more participatory and deliberative forms? Can democracy survive extreme inequality, when the wealthy can buy influence? What about the tension between majority rule and minority rights? Tocqueville warned of the "tyranny of the majority"; Mill insisted on protecting individual liberty even against popular opinion.

Democracy's deepest philosophical bet is that ordinary people, given the chance to reason together, will govern themselves tolerably well — and that the alternative is worse.
