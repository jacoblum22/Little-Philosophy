Deontology is the ethical theory that judges actions by whether they conform to moral rules or duties, not by their consequences — the view that some things are right or wrong in themselves, regardless of the outcomes they produce.

Kant is the towering figure. His categorical imperative provides two formulations that have shaped moral philosophy ever since. The first: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law." If you can't universalize a principle without contradiction (like "always lie" — which destroys trust and makes lying pointless), then the action is wrong. The second: "Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never merely as a means." People are not tools to be used; they have inherent dignity.

The power of deontology is its refusal to sacrifice individuals for the greater good. Consequentialism can justify horrifying actions if the math works out: torturing one person to save a thousand, punishing an innocent person to prevent riots. Deontology says no — some things are simply wrong, regardless of what they prevent. This captures a deep moral intuition that most people share.

The weakness is inflexibility. The classic thought experiment: if a murderer asks where your friend is hiding, Kant seems committed to saying you must tell the truth. Most people find this absurd. Deontologists have developed more sophisticated responses (you can remain silent, misdirect, or argue that the duty not to lie doesn't extend to people who forfeit their right to truth), but the tension between rigid rules and messy reality persists.

Deontological ideas appear across cultures. The Confucian emphasis on li (proper conduct) and role-specific duties, the Islamic concept of fard (obligatory actions in Sharia), and the Jewish emphasis on mitzvot (commandments) all share the deontological intuition that morality is about doing what's right, not calculating what's useful.
