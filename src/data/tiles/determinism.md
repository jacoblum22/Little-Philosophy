Determinism is the view that every event, including every human decision, is the inevitable result of prior causes — that given the complete state of the universe at any moment, only one future is possible.

Laplace gave the most vivid formulation: imagine an intelligence that knows the position and velocity of every particle in the universe. Such a being could, in principle, predict the entire future and reconstruct the entire past. Nothing would be uncertain; nothing would be genuinely open. This is sometimes called "Laplace's demon," and it captures the deterministic worldview in its purest form.

The philosophical stakes are enormous. If determinism is true, then free will — the feeling that you could have done otherwise — is an illusion. You chose coffee over tea this morning not because of any genuine deliberation but because the laws of physics, applied to the state of your brain, made coffee inevitable. The feeling of choosing was real; the choosing itself was not.

There are three main responses. Hard determinists accept this conclusion: free will is an illusion, and we need to rethink responsibility, punishment, and praise accordingly. Compatibilists (like Hume and Dennett) argue that determinism and free will are compatible: a determined action can still be free if it flows from your own character and desires rather than external coercion. Libertarians (in the metaphysical sense) reject determinism itself, arguing that human choices are genuinely undetermined.

Quantum mechanics complicated the picture by introducing genuine randomness at the subatomic level. If some events are truly random, the universe is not strictly deterministic. But this doesn't obviously help with free will — a random choice is not the same as a free one. Whether quantum indeterminacy scales up to affect brain processes, and whether it would constitute freedom even if it did, remain open questions. Determinism may be false, but the alternative isn't clearly freedom.
