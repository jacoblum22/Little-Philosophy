Devotion is the sustained, wholehearted commitment to something beyond yourself — a practice, a person, a cause, or a divine reality — that shapes who you are through its persistence.

Devotional love isn't a feeling that comes and goes; it's a stance you maintain through the fluctuations of feeling. This is what distinguishes devotion from infatuation or enthusiasm. Devotion continues when emotions cool, when results are uncertain, when the work is tedious. It's what keeps the monk at prayer, the musician at practice, the caretaker at the bedside.

In Hindu philosophy, *bhakti* (devotion) is one of the primary paths to liberation — alongside knowledge (*jnana*), action (*karma*), and meditation (*raja*). The *bhakti* movement, which transformed Indian religion from roughly the 7th century onward, democratized spiritual life by teaching that loving devotion to God is available to everyone, regardless of caste, learning, or ritual status. The Tamil poet-saints (Alvars and Nayanars), Mirabai, Kabir, and Tukaram all expressed a fierce, ecstatic devotion that bypassed priestly authority and institutional structures.

In Christian contemplative traditions, devotion takes the form of sustained attention to God — through liturgy, lectio divina, the rosary, or the Jesus Prayer. Brother Lawrence's *Practice of the Presence of God* describes devotion not as dramatic religious experience but as the quiet habit of turning toward God in everyday tasks: cooking, cleaning, mending.

Sufi tradition centers on *ishq* — passionate, all-consuming love for the Divine. Rumi's poetry describes the devotee as a moth drawn to a flame, willing to be annihilated in the beloved. This isn't masochism; it's the recognition that the ego must be dissolved for union with the Real.

Devoted attention, whether religious or secular, has a characteristic shape: it narrows focus, deepens engagement, and gradually transforms the devoted person. You become what you attend to. Devotion is the slow work of becoming.
