Dharma is one of the richest and most untranslatable concepts in philosophy — it encompasses cosmic law, moral duty, the right path, and the fundamental order of things.

The word comes from the Sanskrit root *dhṛ* — "to hold, to support." Dharma is what holds the universe together. In Hinduism, it means both the cosmic order that sustains reality and the specific duties that come with your station in life. In Buddhism, it means the teachings of the Buddha and the truth about how things are. In Jainism, it's a fundamental category of reality itself. Each tradition has developed the concept differently, but the underlying intuition is shared: there is a right way things should go, a pattern woven into the fabric of existence.

In Hindu thought, dharma operates at multiple levels. *Rita* and *satya* — cosmic order and truth — are the broadest expressions: the forces that keep the sun rising, the seasons turning, the moral universe intact. *Varnashrama dharma* is more specific: the duties attached to your particular caste (*varna*) and stage of life (*ashrama*). A student has different duties than a householder; a warrior has different duties than a priest. The Bhagavad Gita's central drama turns on this: Arjuna, a warrior, doesn't want to fight. Krishna tells him that fulfilling his dharma — fighting the just battle — is more important than his personal feelings about it.

This raises a philosophical tension. Is dharma universal or relative? If your dharma depends on your social position, does that justify an oppressive caste system? Reformers from the Buddha onward challenged the rigid social dimensions of dharma while preserving its ethical core. The Buddha redefined dharma as the truth of suffering, impermanence, and the path to liberation — available to everyone regardless of birth.

Dharma also has a deeply personal dimension. It's not just about following rules — it's about finding *your* right path, the way of living that aligns with who you are and what the situation demands. In this sense, dharma is less a fixed law and more an ongoing discernment: what does this moment ask of me?
