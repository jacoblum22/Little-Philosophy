Dialogue is a conversation aimed not at winning but at understanding — a shared inquiry where the participants are genuinely open to being changed by what they hear.

This is harder than it sounds. Most of what passes for dialogue is actually two monologues taking turns. Each person waits for the other to stop talking so they can make their point. Real dialogue requires something more vulnerable: the willingness to entertain the possibility that you might be wrong, that the other person might see something you've missed.

Socrates was the great champion of philosophical dialogue. His method — now called the Socratic method — involved asking question after question, exposing contradictions in his interlocutor's beliefs, until both parties arrived at a deeper understanding. Notably, Socrates rarely claimed to have answers himself. The dialogue was the point: the process of inquiry, not the destination. Plato's dialogues preserve this method, showing philosophy not as a set of doctrines but as a living practice of thinking together.

The idea of dialogue extends far beyond Western philosophy. Martin Buber distinguished between "I-It" relationships (treating the other as an object) and "I-Thou" relationships (encountering the other as a genuine presence). Dialogue, for Buber, is the hallmark of I-Thou encounter — it can't happen if you've already decided what the other person is. Across wisdom traditions, the deepest insights emerge not from solitary reflection alone but from the friction and surprise of genuine conversation. The question is whether our current ways of communicating — fast, performative, often anonymous — still make real dialogue possible.
