Dialogue is a structured exchange of ideas — communication elevated by questioning. It's not just talking, but thinking together, testing ideas against each other's perspectives in pursuit of truth.

In philosophy, dialogue holds a special place. Plato wrote almost all of his works as dialogues, featuring Socrates in conversation with friends, students, and rivals. The form itself embodies a conviction: that truth emerges not from solitary thinking but from the give-and-take of conversation. Genuine dialogue requires humility — the willingness to be wrong — and courage — the willingness to follow the argument wherever it leads.
