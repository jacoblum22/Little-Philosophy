Dignity is the inherent worth that every person possesses simply by being a person — the quality that makes someone deserving of respect regardless of their achievements, status, or usefulness.

Kant gave dignity its most influential philosophical grounding. Because humans are rational beings capable of moral action, they have a "dignity" (Würde) that is beyond all price. Objects have a price and can be exchanged for equivalent value; persons have dignity and cannot. This is why using someone merely as a means to your own ends — deceiving them, coercing them, exploiting them — violates their dignity. The second formulation of the categorical imperative ("treat humanity always as an end, never merely as a means") is essentially a command to respect dignity.

The concept anchors modern human rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) opens with the "inherent dignity" of all members of the human family. If dignity is inherent — not earned, not granted by a government, not dependent on social status — then rights cannot be revoked. This is a powerful philosophical claim: it means that even prisoners, even enemies, even those society deems worthless possess an inviolable worth.

But the concept has philosophical tensions. If dignity is grounded in rationality (as Kant argues), what about infants, the severely cognitively disabled, or people in comas? Some philosophers extend the basis beyond rationality to sentience, to being a member of the human species, or to being a subject-of-a-life. The African concept of ubuntu ("I am because we are") grounds dignity not in individual rationality but in relational being: your worth comes from your connection to the community.

The practical question is how to protect dignity in a world that constantly violates it. Poverty, humiliation, dehumanizing language, and institutional cruelty all attack dignity. The philosophical concept only matters if it translates into political and personal practice.
