Doubt is the unsettling feeling that strikes when you start questioning not just the world, but your own beliefs, assumptions, and certainties. Can I really trust what I think I know?

In philosophy, doubt is one of the most powerful tools we have. The ancient Skeptics made doubt their entire philosophy, questioning whether any knowledge is truly certain. Centuries later, Descartes turned doubt into a method — systematically doubting everything until he found something he couldn't doubt ("I think, therefore I am"). In many traditions, doubt is the first step on the path to wisdom: you have to let go of false certainties before you can find genuine understanding.
