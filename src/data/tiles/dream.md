A dream is an experience that feels real while it's happening but comes from within the mind rather than from the external world.

Every night, your brain generates a private reality — complete with sights, sounds, emotions, and narratives — that you accept unquestioningly until you wake up. This raises one of the oldest philosophical questions: how do you know you're not dreaming right now?

Descartes used the dream argument as one of his tools of radical doubt. If dreams can be indistinguishable from waking life, then your senses alone can never guarantee that anything you experience is real. The Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi expressed the same idea in his famous butterfly parable: after dreaming he was a butterfly, he couldn't tell whether he was a man who had dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly now dreaming of being a man. The boundary between dream and reality turns out to be less solid than we normally assume.

In some traditions, the blurred boundary between dream and reality isn't a problem but a teaching. In Hindu philosophy, the concept of maya suggests that ordinary waking experience is itself a kind of dream — a cosmic illusion projected by the mind. The Aboriginal Australian concept of the Dreamtime isn't a state of sleep but the foundational reality from which the visible world emerges. And Tibetan Buddhism includes dream yoga — the deliberate practice of becoming lucid within dreams — as a method for recognizing the dream-like nature of all experience. The philosophical question of dreaming isn't really about what happens when you sleep. It's about what it takes to genuinely wake up.
