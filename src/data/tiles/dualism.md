Dualism is the idea that reality — or at least human reality — is made of two fundamentally different kinds of stuff: mind and matter.

It seems like common sense. Your thoughts feel nothing like your toenails. When you imagine a sunset, there's no physical sun inside your head. The mental and the physical seem like completely different categories of thing. Dualism is the philosophical position that takes this intuition seriously and insists that the difference isn't just apparent — it's real.

Descartes gave the most famous version. In his *Meditations*, he argued that he could doubt the existence of his body (maybe he's dreaming, maybe an evil demon is tricking him) but could not doubt the existence of his mind (the very act of doubting proves there's a doubter). So mind and body must be different substances: *res cogitans* (thinking stuff) and *res extensa* (extended stuff, i.e., matter). The mind is non-physical, indivisible, and free. The body is physical, divisible, and determined by mechanical laws.

The immediate problem — so immediate that Descartes's contemporaries raised it — is interaction. If mind and body are completely different substances, how do they affect each other? When you decide to raise your arm, how does a non-physical thought cause a physical movement? When you stub your toe, how does a physical event cause a non-physical experience of pain? Descartes suggested the pineal gland as the point of contact, but this just pushes the mystery to a smaller location without solving it.

Historically, dualism has deep roots beyond Descartes. Plato distinguished the eternal soul from the mortal body. Hindu philosophy distinguishes *purusha* (pure consciousness) from *prakriti* (matter, nature). Many religious traditions assume some form of dualism to ground the possibility of an afterlife — if your soul is distinct from your body, it can survive your body's death.

Modern philosophy of mind has largely turned against dualism. Physicalists argue that everything, including consciousness, is ultimately physical. Functionalists say mental states are defined by what they do, not what they're made of. But the "hard problem of consciousness" — why physical processes give rise to subjective experience at all — keeps dualism's ghost alive. However unfashionable, the intuition that consciousness is something fundamentally different from matter refuses to die.
