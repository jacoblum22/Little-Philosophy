Duty is what you are morally required to do, regardless of whether you want to — the obligation that binds you even when inclination pulls the other way.

Kant made duty the foundation of his entire moral philosophy. The only truly moral action, he argued, is one done from duty — not from desire, habit, or self-interest, but from respect for the moral law. If you help someone because you enjoy helping, that's nice but not morally praiseworthy. If you help someone because you recognize it's your duty, even when you'd rather not, that's genuinely moral. This sounds austere, and it is. Kant's ethics is demanding precisely because it refuses to let you off the hook when doing right is hard.

The concept of duty has deep roots outside Western philosophy. In Hindu thought, dharma encompasses duty specific to your station in life (varnashrama dharma) and universal moral duty (sanatana dharma). The Bhagavad Gita's central drama turns on Arjuna's conflict of duties: his duty as a warrior to fight versus his duty as a kinsman not to kill his relatives. Krishna's answer — perform your duty without attachment to results — became one of the most influential ethical teachings in history.

Confucian philosophy similarly emphasizes duty through the concept of li (ritual propriety) and the five relationships, each with its specific obligations: ruler to subject, parent to child, husband to wife, elder to younger, friend to friend. Duty here is not abstract but relational — you act rightly by fulfilling the specific responsibilities of your role.

The critique of duty-based ethics is that it can become rigid and blind. What if two duties conflict? Kant's system struggles with this. And what if a sense of duty is manipulated by authority — the soldier who commits atrocities "because it was my duty"? The question is whether duty is the foundation of morality or just one piece of it.
