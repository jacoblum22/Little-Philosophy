An elegy is a poem or song of mourning — a literary form dedicated to lamenting the dead, the lost, or the irretrievable. But elegy is more than grief set to meter; it's a philosophical meditation on mortality, memory, and the meaning we make from loss.

The elegiac tradition stretches back to the ancient world. Greek elegiac couplets were originally accompanied by the flute and used for everything from war songs to love poems, but the form gradually became associated with mourning. The great English elegies — Milton's *Lycidas*, Shelley's *Adonais*, Tennyson's *In Memoriam* — don't just grieve; they interrogate grief. They ask what death means, whether the dead are truly gone, and whether art can preserve what time destroys.

Philosophically, elegy confronts the tension between memory and oblivion. To write an elegy is to insist that someone or something mattered — to refuse the universe's apparent indifference to individual existence. But it also acknowledges the limits of that refusal. The poem is not the person. The memorial is not the life. Elegy holds open the space between remembering and letting go.

Elegy also has a political dimension. Resistance poetry in colonized and oppressed communities often takes elegiac form — mourning not just individuals but cultures, languages, and ways of life erased by power. Mahmoud Darwish's poetry for Palestine, the Irish *caoineadh* (keen) tradition, African American spirituals and blues — these are collective elegies that transform private grief into public testimony. The elegy says: this loss happened, and it must be witnessed.
