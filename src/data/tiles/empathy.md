Empathy is the ability to feel what another person feels — to step outside your own perspective and imagine the world through someone else's eyes.

But is empathy really "feeling what someone else feels"? Or is it something different — an act of imagination, a guess, a projection of your own experience onto another person? Philosophers have long debated whether true empathy is even possible. After all, you can never directly access someone else's mind. When you "feel" another person's pain, are you feeling their pain, or are you feeling your own version of it?

Despite these puzzles, nearly every moral tradition places empathy somewhere near the foundation of ethics. Adam Smith called it "fellow-feeling" — the instinctive tendency to mirror the emotions of those around us. Confucius taught shu, the capacity to measure others' feelings by your own. In Buddhism, karuna (compassion) begins with empathetic awareness of suffering. These traditions converge on a common insight: morality isn't just about following rules. It starts with caring about what happens to other people.

The harder question is whether empathy is enough. Some contemporary philosophers argue that empathy can be misleading — it tends to favor people who look like us, who are nearby, or whose suffering is vivid and dramatic. Paul Bloom has argued for "rational compassion" over empathy: caring about people's well-being without being overwhelmed by their emotions. Is empathy a guide to morality, or a starting point that reason must refine?
