Empathy is the ability to feel what another person feels — to step outside your own perspective and imagine the world through someone else's eyes. It's what happens when the self reaches toward the other.

Empathy is at the heart of moral philosophy. Many thinkers argue that our sense of right and wrong begins with empathy — we care about others because we can feel their pain and joy. Adam Smith called it "fellow-feeling," the Buddhists speak of karuna (compassion), and Confucius taught that the foundation of goodness is shu — the ability to consider others as you consider yourself.
