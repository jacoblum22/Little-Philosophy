Empiricism is the view that all knowledge comes from experience — that the mind begins as a blank slate (tabula rasa) and that everything we know is ultimately derived from what we see, hear, touch, taste, and smell.

John Locke launched the classical empiricist tradition in his "Essay Concerning Human Understanding." Against the rationalists (who believed some knowledge is innate), Locke insisted that at birth the mind is empty. All ideas — from simple sensations (redness, warmth) to complex concepts (justice, infinity) — are built up from sensory experience. There are no innate ideas, no knowledge imprinted on the soul at birth.

George Berkeley pushed empiricism further: if all knowledge comes from experience, and experience consists only of perceptions, then we can never know anything beyond our perceptions. The "external world" — matter existing independently of minds — is an unnecessary hypothesis. To be is to be perceived (esse est percipi). This sounds radical, but Berkeley's point was that the concept of unperceived matter is incoherent: try to conceive of something that no one is conceiving.

David Hume took empiricism to its logical extreme and found it devastating. If all knowledge comes from experience, then we can't know anything about causation (we only experience correlation), the self (we only experience a bundle of perceptions), or the future (experience tells us only about the past). Hume's skepticism threatened to undermine science, morality, and common sense — all from premises that seemed reasonable.

Kant famously said that Hume "awakened him from his dogmatic slumber," and responded by arguing that experience is necessary for knowledge but not sufficient: the mind also contributes structures (space, time, causation) that organize experience. Pure empiricism leads to skepticism; pure rationalism to empty speculation. Both are needed.
