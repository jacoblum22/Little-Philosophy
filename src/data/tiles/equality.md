Equality is the principle that all people deserve the same basic status, rights, and consideration — that no one is inherently superior or inferior by virtue of birth, race, sex, wealth, or any other arbitrary distinction.

The idea has a complicated history. Ancient Greek democracy was equality for citizens — but not for women, slaves, or foreigners. The Stoics came closer, arguing that all human beings share in logos (reason) and therefore share equal moral worth. Christianity declared that all souls are equal before God, while maintaining hierarchies on Earth. The Enlightenment pushed equality into politics: Locke's claim that people are born with equal natural rights helped inspire the American and French revolutions.

But equal in what sense? This is where philosophy gets difficult. Equality of opportunity says everyone should have the same starting point — access to education, fair legal treatment, no artificial barriers. Equality of outcome says that equal starting points aren't enough if structural inequalities persist — what matters is that people actually end up with comparable resources and well-being. These two visions lead to very different politics.

John Rawls offered the most influential modern theory. His "difference principle" says inequalities are permissible only if they benefit the least advantaged members of society. From behind a "veil of ignorance" (not knowing your own position in society), rational people would choose this arrangement — because you'd want a safety net in case you ended up at the bottom.

Critics from both sides push back. Libertarians like Robert Nozick argue that enforced equality violates individual freedom: if people freely exchange goods and labor, the resulting inequality is just. Marxists argue that formal equality (equal rights under law) is meaningless without substantive equality (equal access to resources and power). The tension between freedom and equality, between equal treatment and equal outcome, remains one of political philosophy's defining struggles.
