Eros is desire in its most elemental form — the pull toward what is beautiful, what is missing, what would complete you.

In modern English, "erotic" has narrowed to mean sexual. But for the Greeks, *eros* was much larger. It was the force that drives you toward beauty, toward knowledge, toward union with what you love. It's the magnetism of the unfinished soul reaching toward something beyond itself.

Plato's *Symposium* offers the most famous philosophical account. At a drinking party, each guest gives a speech praising love. The climax is Socrates' retelling of what the priestess Diotima taught him. Love, she says, is neither a god nor a mortal but a *daimon* — a spirit that mediates between the human and the divine. And love is not the possession of beauty but the *desire* for it. Crucially, eros points beyond its immediate object. You begin by loving a beautiful body, then you recognize beauty in all bodies, then in souls, then in knowledge, and finally you glimpse Beauty itself — eternal, absolute, unchanging. Eros is the ladder from the particular to the universal.

Aristotle's account is more grounded. In the *Nicomachean Ethics*, he discusses different forms of love and friendship (*philia*), distinguishing relationships of pleasure, utility, and virtue. The highest friendship — between people of good character who love each other for who they are — is rare, slow to develop, and the most important human relationship.

The troubadour tradition of medieval Europe transformed eros into courtly love — passionate, unfulfilled longing idealized as ennobling. Schopenhauer saw eros as the "will to life" in disguise — sexual desire tricking individuals into serving the species' reproductive purposes. Freud made it a universal drive (*libido*) underlying all human creativity and civilization.

But perhaps the most interesting claim about eros comes from Plato's myth of the original humans: beings with four arms, four legs, and two faces, split in half by Zeus. Love is the yearning to find your other half, to be whole again. Whatever its metaphysical status, the felt reality of eros — that ache for completion — is one of the most universal human experiences.
