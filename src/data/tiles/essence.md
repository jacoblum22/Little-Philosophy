Essence is what makes a thing what it is — the core properties without which it would be something else entirely.

Plato located essences in a realm of perfect, eternal Forms. The essence of a circle isn't found in any drawn circle (which is always slightly imperfect) but in the Form of Circularity itself — perfect, unchanging, and grasped by reason rather than the senses. Every actual circle participates in this Form, which is what makes it a circle rather than something else. Aristotle brought essence down to earth, arguing that each thing has an essence but not in a separate realm — the essence of a horse is in the horse, as the organizing principle that makes it a horse and not a dog.

The concept of essence has been philosophically powerful but also dangerous. If you believe that things have fixed essences, you might conclude that human nature is fixed too — that men and women, different races, different classes have essential natures that determine their proper roles. This is essentialism, and it has been used to justify all manner of oppression.

The existentialists, especially Sartre, launched the most famous attack. "Existence precedes essence," Sartre declared. A paper-knife has an essence — someone designed it to cut paper. But a human being has no pre-given design. You exist first, and then through your choices, you create whatever "essence" you have. There is no human nature that determines what you must be; you are radically free to define yourself.

The question of essence remains alive in unexpected places. When we debate whether a genetically modified organism is "still really" corn, whether a ship rebuilt plank by plank is "still the same" ship, or whether a person who has lost all their memories is "still the same" person, we are asking about essence — about what makes something fundamentally itself.
