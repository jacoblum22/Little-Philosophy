Ethics is the systematic study of right and wrong — what emerges when your inner conscience meets the existence of others. If it were just you alone in the world, there would be no need for ethics. It's the presence of other beings that makes moral questions unavoidable.

Ethics is one of the broadest branches of philosophy. Virtue ethics (Aristotle) asks: what kind of person should I be? Deontology (Kant) asks: what rules should I follow? Consequentialism (Mill) asks: what actions produce the best outcomes? Each approach gives different answers to the same fundamental question: how should we live? Despite centuries of debate, philosophers continue to disagree — which may be part of the point. Ethics is less about finding final answers and more about learning to think carefully about the hardest questions.
