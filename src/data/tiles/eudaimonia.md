Eudaimonia is the ancient Greek concept of human flourishing — a deep, lasting state of living well and doing well. It's often translated as "happiness," but it means something far richer than pleasure or feeling good. It's the kind of fulfillment that comes from living a virtuous and meaningful life.

Socrates taught that eudaimonia comes from virtue — that no one who is truly good can be truly harmed, and that wisdom is the path to flourishing. Aristotle expanded on this, arguing that eudaimonia is "activity of the soul in accordance with virtue" — it's not something you feel, but something you do, over the course of a whole lifetime. You achieve eudaimonia not by chasing pleasure, but by cultivating excellence in everything you do: thinking, loving, creating, and living in community.

The concept of eudaimonia unifies much of ancient Greek ethics. It's the answer to the most fundamental ethical question: what is the good life?
