Evidence is whatever provides rational support for believing something — the grounds on which a claim rests, the data that makes a hypothesis more (or less) likely to be true.

The concept seems straightforward until you ask: what counts as evidence? And how much evidence is enough? Empiricists, from Locke to modern scientists, privilege sensory evidence: what you can see, hear, measure, and test. But testimony (what other people tell you) is also evidence, and most of what you know comes from testimony rather than direct observation — you didn't personally verify that the Earth orbits the sun.

The relationship between evidence and belief is complex. Bayesian epistemology provides a formal framework: you start with a prior probability (how likely you already think something is) and update it based on new evidence. Strong evidence shifts your probability significantly; weak evidence shifts it slightly. This explains why the same evidence can rationally lead different people to different conclusions — their priors differ.

But evidence doesn't interpret itself. The philosopher-scientist Pierre Duhem showed that when an experiment produces unexpected results, you can't always determine which part of your theory is wrong — the main hypothesis, the auxiliary assumptions, or the experimental setup. This "underdetermination" means evidence alone rarely settles a question definitively. Thomas Kuhn went further: during scientific revolutions, the same evidence is interpreted differently by adherents of different paradigms. Evidence is theory-laden.

The question of evidence also has ethical dimensions. In law, "evidence" has specific rules governing what can be presented and how it should be weighed. In everyday life, we constantly make evidential judgments — about the news we consume, the people we trust, the claims we accept. The ability to evaluate evidence well is not just an intellectual skill; it's a civic and moral one.
