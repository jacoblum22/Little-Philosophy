Evil is whatever is deeply, seriously wrong — not just unfortunate or unpleasant but genuinely terrible, the kind of thing that makes you question whether the world is fundamentally good.

The oldest and most powerful philosophical question about evil is the problem of evil (theodicy): if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good, why does evil exist? Augustine answered that evil is not a positive thing but a privation — an absence of good, the way darkness is an absence of light. God created everything good; evil enters through the misuse of free will. This explanation has survived for sixteen centuries, though many find it strained when confronted with natural evils like earthquakes and childhood cancer, which involve no human choice.

The distinction between natural evil (suffering caused by nature) and moral evil (suffering caused by human choices) has shaped the debate. Free-will defenses can address moral evil: perhaps a world with free agents who can choose badly is better than a world of programmed goodness. But natural evil resists this explanation. What freedom is served by a tsunami?

Hannah Arendt introduced a disturbing idea after observing the trial of Adolf Eichmann: the "banality of evil." Eichmann wasn't a monster or a fanatic but a bureaucrat who never really thought about what he was doing. Evil, Arendt suggested, doesn't always come from malice — it can come from thoughtlessness, from the failure to think. This is perhaps more frightening than demonic evil, because it means anyone is capable of participating in atrocity simply by not paying attention.

Buddhist philosophy doesn't use the concept of evil in quite the same way. What Western thought calls evil, Buddhism explains through ignorance (avidya) and craving (tanha). People don't do terrible things because they're evil but because they're confused about the nature of reality and the sources of happiness. The remedy is not punishment but awakening.
