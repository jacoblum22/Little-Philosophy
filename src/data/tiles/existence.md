Existence is the brute fact that something is — that there is something rather than nothing — and it is perhaps the most fundamental and mysterious concept in all of philosophy.

Leibniz asked the question that keeps metaphysicians up at night: "Why is there something rather than nothing?" It seems like nothing would be simpler, more natural, more default. Yet here we are, surrounded by a universe of existing things. Religious traditions have answered with creation: something exists because God willed it into being. But that only pushes the question back — why does God exist?

The existentialists made existence their starting point. Heidegger coined the term Dasein ("being-there") to describe the unique way humans exist: not just present like a rock, but aware of their own existence, concerned about it, and confronting the possibility of non-existence (death). Existence for humans is not a passive state but an active condition — we are always "thrown" into a specific situation and always projecting ourselves toward future possibilities.

Sartre distinguished two modes of being: being-in-itself (the solid, self-identical existence of things like rocks and tables) and being-for-itself (the existence of consciousness, which is always aware of itself and therefore always at a distance from itself — never simply what it is). Human existence is characterized by this gap, this nothingness at the heart of consciousness, which is the source of both our freedom and our anguish.

In Indian philosophy, the relationship between existence and ultimate reality takes a different form. Advaita Vedanta teaches that the everyday world of separate, existing things is maya — not quite illusion, but not the deepest reality either. True existence (sat) belongs to Brahman alone, the unchanging, undivided ground of all being. The question is not "why does anything exist?" but "what truly exists, beneath the appearances?"
