Existential courage is the resolve to face life's deepest uncertainties — meaninglessness, death, radical freedom, the absence of guarantees — without retreating into comforting illusions. It's courage directed not at an external threat but at the conditions of existence itself.

Paul Tillich called it "the courage to be" and made it the subject of an entire book. He identified three forms of anxiety that threaten human existence: anxiety about fate and death (we will die and can't control when), anxiety about emptiness and meaninglessness (we may live without purpose), and anxiety about guilt and condemnation (we may fail morally). Existential courage is the capacity to affirm life in the face of all three — to say "yes" to existence despite having no guarantee that it's worth saying yes to.

This is different from ordinary courage, which involves facing a specific danger. Existential courage faces the danger of existence as such. Kierkegaard's "leap of faith" is an act of existential courage — committing to something (God, love, a life project) without the certainty that rational proof would provide. Camus's idea that "one must imagine Sisyphus happy" is existential courage in the face of absurdity: continuing to push the boulder not because it will reach the top, but because the pushing itself can be enough.

Heidegger's notion of "being-toward-death" (*Sein-zum-Tode*) suggests that confronting your own mortality honestly — rather than fleeing into distraction — is the precondition for authentic existence. Existential courage doesn't eliminate anxiety; it lives with it. The existentially courageous person doesn't pretend to have answers but faces the questions with open eyes.
