Existentialism is the philosophical movement that begins with a jarring claim: you exist first, and only then do you define what you are. There is no blueprint.

A hammer has an essence before it exists — someone designs it with a purpose in mind, then builds it. Existentialism's central insight is that human beings are not like hammers. You weren't designed for a purpose. You showed up in the world, and now you have to figure out what to do with yourself. "Existence precedes essence" means that what you *are* is determined by what you *do* — by the choices you make, the commitments you honor, the life you build.

Kierkegaard is often called the first existentialist, though the label came later. He railed against the Hegelian system that tried to explain everything from the outside, insisting that philosophy must begin with the existing individual — the person who has to choose, who feels anxiety, who stands before God alone. His "leap of faith" is existential: it can't be justified by reason alone but must be *made* by a concrete person in a concrete moment.

Heidegger shifted the focus to the question of Being. In *Being and Time*, he analyzed human existence (*Dasein*) as fundamentally different from the existence of objects. We don't just *occur* — we have a relationship to our own existence. We care about it, project ourselves into the future, and are shaped by the awareness that we will die. This self-relating, future-oriented, death-aware existence is what makes human life a philosophical problem like no other.

Sartre gave existentialism its most famous formulations. Without God, there is no human nature — no fixed essence that determines who we should be. We are "condemned to be free," radically responsible for everything we become. The anguish this produces is real, and most people flee it through "bad faith" — pretending their choices are determined by circumstances, biology, or social roles.

Simone de Beauvoir applied existentialist thinking to gender and oppression. Camus explored the absurd tension between our need for meaning and the universe's silence. Fanon extended existentialism to the colonial situation, analyzing how racism creates a distorted existential condition for the colonized.

Existentialism's critics accuse it of being self-absorbed, depressing, or impossibly demanding. Its defenders reply that it's simply honest — the refusal to look away from the conditions of human life.
