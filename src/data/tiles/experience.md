Experience is what happens when a conscious being encounters the world — the raw flow of sensations, feelings, and impressions that makes up your moment-to-moment existence.

Right now, you're having an experience. You see shapes and colors, you feel the weight of your body, you hear sounds. But experience isn't just passive reception — it's already shaped by who you are. Two people can look at the same sunset and have profoundly different experiences, because experience is never just about the world "out there." It's about the meeting point between a mind and its surroundings.

Philosophers have fought bitterly over the relationship between experience and knowledge. The empiricists — Locke, Berkeley, Hume — argued that experience is the only source of genuine knowledge. The mind at birth is a blank slate, and everything we know comes from what we see, hear, and touch. The rationalists — Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza — pushed back: some knowledge (mathematics, logic, the existence of God) doesn't come from experience at all but from the mind's own activity. Kant's great synthesis argued that experience and reason work together: experience provides the raw material, but the mind organizes it into something intelligible.

In the 20th century, phenomenologists like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty argued that philosophy had been asking the wrong question. Instead of asking "what can we know from experience?" we should ask "what is experience itself?" What is it like to perceive, to remember, to imagine? These questions remain some of the most fertile in philosophy — because experience is the one thing we can never step outside of.
