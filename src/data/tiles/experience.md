Experience is the raw material of all knowledge — the sights, sounds, feelings, and thoughts that make up your conscious life.

Philosophers have long debated what role experience plays in understanding. Empiricists like John Locke argued that the mind starts as a "blank slate" and everything we know comes from experience. Rationalists like Descartes countered that some knowledge is built into us from the start. But nearly everyone agrees that experience is where philosophy begins — without it, there would be nothing to think about.
