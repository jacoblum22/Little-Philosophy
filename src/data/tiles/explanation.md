Explanation is the act of making something intelligible — showing why something happened, how something works, or what something means, in a way that satisfies a genuine question.

The dominant model in philosophy of science was the deductive-nomological (DN) model, proposed by Carl Hempel: to explain an event is to show that it follows logically from general laws and initial conditions. The water froze because the temperature dropped below 0°C and water freezes at 0°C. This seems clean, but it faces problems. The length of a flagpole and the position of the sun can explain the length of its shadow — but the shadow and the sun's position can't explain the flagpole's length, even though the DN model treats both derivations equally. Explanation seems to involve directionality (causes explain effects, not vice versa) that the DN model doesn't capture.

This led to causal theories of explanation: to explain something is to identify its cause. But Hume's skepticism about causation haunts this approach — if we can't directly observe causal connections, how can we be sure we've identified the right cause?

The distinction between explanation and understanding matters. Wilhelm Dilthey argued that the natural sciences explain (Erklären) through causal laws, while the human sciences understand (Verstehen) through empathic interpretation. You explain why a bridge collapsed through physics; you understand why a person made a decision through empathy, context, and interpretation. These are fundamentally different intellectual activities, and forcing the human sciences to imitate natural-scientific explanation distorts what they do.

Explanations also have a pragmatic dimension: what counts as a good explanation depends on who's asking and why. A physicist, a chemist, and a civil engineer might give different but equally valid explanations of the same bridge collapse, each relevant to different questions and purposes.
