Exploitation is the systematic extraction of value from people who receive less than they produce — the structural unfairness that hides inside transactions that look voluntary.

The word carries moral weight because it describes a relationship in which one party benefits disproportionately from the labor, vulnerability, or need of another. A sweatshop worker "chooses" to work for pennies — but the choice is between starvation and exploitation. A desperate borrower "agrees" to predatory loan terms. The formal appearance of consent masks the underlying coercion of unequal power.

Marx gave exploitation its most influential analysis. Under capitalism, workers produce goods whose value exceeds what they're paid in wages. The difference — *surplus value* — is appropriated by the capitalist. This isn't theft in the legal sense; the worker agreed to the wage. But it's exploitation in the structural sense: the system is set up so that the people who do the work don't get the full benefit of what they create.

Marx's analysis extends beyond individual employers to the system itself. Exploitation isn't a matter of greedy bosses (though those exist); it's a feature of how capitalism organizes production. Even a kind, generous factory owner extracts surplus value — otherwise they couldn't stay in business.

Non-Marxist philosophers have also grappled with exploitation. John Rawls argued that inequalities are only justified if they benefit the least-advantaged members of society. Any arrangement that enriches some at the expense of others without this justification is exploitative. Martha Nussbaum connects exploitation to the capabilities approach: exploitation denies people the basic capabilities — health, education, political participation — they need for a fully human life.

The challenge of exploitation is that it's often invisible to those who benefit from it. The cheap products, the convenient services, the comfortable lifestyles of wealthy nations are often built on exploitation that happens far away, out of sight, and easy to ignore.
