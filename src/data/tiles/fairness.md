Fairness is the sense that people should be treated equitably — that the rules, whatever they are, shouldn't arbitrarily favor some over others.

Almost everyone has an instinctive sense of fairness. Children as young as two protest when they receive less than a sibling. Studies show that even monkeys reject unequal rewards. But philosophical fairness goes deeper than "I should get my share." It asks: what counts as a fair share? Fair by what standard? Equal distribution? Proportional to effort? Proportional to need? Each answer leads to a radically different social arrangement.

The most influential modern theory of fairness comes from John Rawls itself. Rawls asked: what principles would rational people choose if they didn't know their own position in society — their talents, wealth, race, or gender? Behind this "veil of ignorance," Rawls argued, people would choose two principles: equal basic liberties for everyone, and a system where inequalities are only allowed if they benefit the least advantaged members of society. The power of the thought experiment is that it attempts to separate fairness from self-interest.

But Rawls was writing within a specific tradition. Confucian thought approaches fairness differently — not through abstract principles but through properly ordered relationships, where each person fulfills their role with benevolence and sincerity. Indigenous justice traditions often emphasize restorative fairness — repairing harm and restoring relationships — rather than the punitive fairness of Western legal systems. The deepest question about fairness may be whether there's a universal standard or whether every culture builds its own.
