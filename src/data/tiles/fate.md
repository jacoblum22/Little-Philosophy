Fate is the idea that the future is already written — that what will happen to you was always going to happen, regardless of what you choose.

It's one of the oldest ideas in human thought, and one of the most unsettling. The Greek concept of *moira* (fate, destiny) held that even the gods were bound by necessity. Oedipus does everything in his power to avoid his fate — killing his father and marrying his mother — and every action he takes to escape it brings him closer. The tragic irony isn't just dramatic; it's philosophical. Can you escape what was always going to happen? And if not, what does that mean for your freedom?

The Stoics had a sophisticated answer. They accepted fate completely — the universe is governed by *logos* (divine reason), and everything that happens is part of a rational, determined order. But they argued that acceptance of fate *is* freedom. Seneca's metaphor: a dog tied to a cart can either run willingly alongside it or be dragged. Either way, the cart goes where it goes. The difference is in the dog's experience. Amor fati — love of fate — is the Stoic ideal, later revived by Nietzsche: not just accepting what happens but *willing* it, affirming every moment of existence.

Calvinist theology proposed predestination: God has already determined who will be saved and who will be damned, and nothing you do can change it. This produced, paradoxically, extraordinary moral and economic energy — Weber's famous "Protestant ethic" — as believers tried to demonstrate through worldly success that they were among the elect.

In Hindu philosophy, fate intersects with karma: your current circumstances are the fruit of past actions (in this life and previous ones). This isn't blind fate but moral causation — a universe where nothing is arbitrary, even if the causal chains are too complex to trace.

The deepest philosophical question about fate is whether it's compatible with moral responsibility. If everything is determined, can you be praised or blamed for anything? Compatibilists say yes — you're responsible for actions that flow from your character, even if that character was shaped by forces beyond your control. Hard determinists say no — responsibility requires the ability to have done otherwise, and fate rules that out.

Fate is the dark twin of freedom — and you can't fully understand either without the other.
