Fitra is the Islamic concept of the natural, primordial disposition with which every human being is born — an innate orientation toward God, truth, and moral goodness.

In Islamic theology, fitra is the original human nature before it gets covered over by social conditioning, sinful habits, and cultural distortion. A famous hadith (saying of the Prophet Muhammad) states: "Every child is born upon the fitra. It is their parents who make them Jewish, Christian, or Zoroastrian." The implication is striking: the deepest layer of human nature is not sinful (as in some Christian interpretations of original sin) but *good* — naturally inclined toward recognizing God and acting righteously.

This doesn't mean that humans automatically behave well. Fitra can be corrupted, buried, or distorted by upbringing, environment, and personal choices. But it can never be completely destroyed. Islamic spiritual practice (*tasawwuf*, or Sufism, in particular) aims to polish the heart, clearing away the accumulated rust of *ghaflah* (heedlessness) to reveal the fitra that was always underneath.

The Quranic basis comes from Surah Ar-Rum (30:30): "So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitra of Allah upon which He has created people." Fitra is not just a psychological trait; it's a theological claim about human design. Humans are *made* to know God, the way eyes are made to see. When they don't, something has gone wrong — but the organ of recognition remains.

Philosophically, fitra resonates with natural law theory in the Western tradition — the idea that moral truths are accessible to human reason by nature, not only through revelation. It also connects to Platonic anamnesis — the idea that the soul already knows the truth and needs only to be reminded. In each case, learning is really remembering; becoming good is really returning to what you already are.

Fitra offers a distinctive Islamic answer to the question of human nature: we don't need to be *made* good. We need to *remember* that we already are.
