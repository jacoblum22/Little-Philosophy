Forgiveness is the decision to release resentment toward someone who has wronged you — not to forget what happened, not to excuse it, but to let go of the claim that the wrongdoer owes you something that can never be repaid.

Hannah Arendt argued that forgiveness is one of the most important and least understood human capacities. Without it, we would be trapped forever by the consequences of our actions — every wrong would generate an unending chain of resentment and retaliation. Forgiveness breaks this chain. It is, Arendt wrote, "the only reaction which does not merely re-act but acts anew and unexpectedly." In this sense, forgiveness is a form of freedom — freedom from the past.

But can everything be forgiven? Jacques Derrida pushed this question to its limit, arguing that true forgiveness must be able to forgive the unforgivable — otherwise it's just excusing what's relatively minor. This creates a paradox: forgiveness is only meaningful when it seems impossible. Derrida distinguished between conditional forgiveness (which requires repentance and serves social harmony) and unconditional forgiveness (which forgives without conditions and is perhaps infinite). Most actual forgiveness falls somewhere between these poles.

Christian theology has made forgiveness central: God forgives human sin through Christ's sacrifice, and Christians are commanded to forgive others as they have been forgiven. The Lord's Prayer makes this explicit — "forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us." Buddhism approaches the same territory differently: holding onto resentment is compared to grasping a hot coal, intending to throw it at someone else but burning only yourself. Letting go is not primarily about the other person but about your own liberation.

The hardest philosophical question about forgiveness is whether it can be demanded or only freely given. If someone demands your forgiveness, is what you give still forgiveness? And if the wrongdoer never repents, can forgiveness be complete? The tension between justice (which demands accountability) and forgiveness (which releases it) has no easy resolution.
