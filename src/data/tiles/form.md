Form is the shape, structure, or pattern that makes a thing what it is — the arrangement that gives matter its identity and intelligibility.

Plato made Form (eidos) the centerpiece of his philosophy. The Forms are perfect, eternal, unchanging blueprints that exist in a realm beyond the physical world. Every beautiful thing in the world is beautiful because it participates in the Form of Beauty; every just act is just because it reflects the Form of Justice. The physical world is a flickering shadow of this higher reality. Philosophy is the ascent from shadows to Forms — from appearance to truth.

Aristotle kept the concept but changed its address. Form isn't in a separate realm; it's in things. The form of a horse is what makes a particular lump of matter a horse rather than a dog or a rock. Form and matter are always intertwined (this is hylomorphism): matter without form is featureless potential; form without matter is an abstract idea with no real existence. Understanding something means grasping its form — the pattern that organizes it.

The concept resonates across traditions. In Chinese aesthetics, the idea of li (pattern, principle) describes the organic form inherent in things — the grain in jade, the branching of rivers, the structure of a good poem. It's not imposed from outside but discovered within. In Japanese aesthetics, form is inseparable from the beauty of transience: the form of a cherry blossom is beautiful precisely because it's fleeting.

In modern philosophy, the concept of form resurfaces in unexpected places. The logical positivists distinguished the form of an argument from its content; Gestalt psychology showed that perception organizes sensory data into forms before we're consciously aware of it. The question is always the same: is form discovered in reality, or imposed by the mind?
