Freedom is the condition of being able to act, think, and choose without being constrained by forces beyond your control — or at least, that's the simple version.

The complicated version has occupied philosophy for millennia, because "freedom" turns out to mean very different things depending on who you ask and what you're free *from*.

The most basic distinction is between *negative* freedom and *positive* freedom, drawn famously by Isaiah Berlin. Negative freedom is freedom from interference — nobody's stopping you, nobody's locking your door, nobody's censoring your speech. This is the freedom prized by classical liberalism: leave me alone and let me do what I want. Positive freedom is freedom *to* — the actual capacity to live a meaningful life, to develop your potential, to govern yourself according to reason. A starving person is technically "free" to do anything, but in practice they're free to do very little.

The ancient Greeks didn't think in these terms. For Aristotle, freedom meant living in a *polis* — a political community — where citizens could participate in self-governance. To be free was to be a citizen, not a slave or a subject. Freedom wasn't privacy; it was public participation.

The Stoics relocated freedom entirely inward. External circumstances — imprisonment, poverty, even torture — cannot touch the free mind. Epictetus, himself a former slave, taught that you are free the moment you stop wanting things you can't control. This radical internalization of freedom has echoed through the centuries, from Christian mysticism to Viktor Frankl's account of finding meaning in a concentration camp.

The existentialists made freedom terrifying. For Sartre, you are *always* free, whether you realize it or not. Even under oppression, you choose how to respond. This isn't a comfortable thought — it means you can never excuse yourself by pointing to circumstances. Freedom and responsibility are inseparable, and both are inescapable.

Political freedom remains fiercely contested. Who should be free? Free to do what? Can freedom exist without equality? Without economic security? These questions define the modern world, and philosophy offers no consensus — only the tools to think them through.
