Friendship is a voluntary relationship between people who genuinely care about each other's well-being — not because they have to, but because they want to.

Aristotle devoted more of the Nicomachean Ethics to friendship than to any other topic — even justice. He distinguished three kinds: friendships of utility (you benefit each other), friendships of pleasure (you enjoy each other's company), and friendships of virtue (you admire each other's character and help each other become better people). Only the last kind, Aristotle argued, is friendship in the fullest sense. The others are real but fragile — they dissolve when the benefit or pleasure runs out.

Why did Aristotle take friendship so seriously? Because he believed that a good life is impossible without it. Humans are social animals, and even the most self-sufficient person needs others — not just for practical help, but for the kind of honest reflection that only a true friend can provide. A real friend is like a mirror: they show you who you are, including the parts you'd rather not see. This is why genuine friendship requires courage alongside affection.

Friendship also raises political and philosophical questions. Cicero asked whether friendship is possible between unequals. Montaigne wrote about his friendship with Étienne de La Boétie as a kind of spiritual union. Feminist philosophers have explored how gender shapes friendship differently. And in an age of social media, where hundreds of "friends" are just a click away, Aristotle's question has become unexpectedly urgent: what makes a relationship a genuine friendship rather than just a connection?
