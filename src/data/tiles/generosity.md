Generosity is the willingness to give more than is required — more of your time, money, attention, or care than strict duty demands. It seems like one of the simpler virtues, but philosophically, it raises deep questions about selflessness, obligation, and the nature of gifts.

Aristotle treated generosity (*eleutheriotes*) as a virtue of the mean: the generous person gives the right amount, to the right people, at the right time. Too little giving is stinginess; too much is prodigality — wasteful spending that depletes your capacity to give in the future. The truly generous person takes pleasure in giving without expecting reciprocation.

But can any gift be truly selfless? Jacques Derrida argued that the "pure gift" is impossible: the moment a gift is recognized as a gift, a cycle of obligation begins — the recipient feels gratitude, the giver feels satisfaction, and the exchange has become economic in a subtle way. For Derrida, genuine generosity would require the giver to forget they gave and the receiver to not recognize the gift — conditions that seem absurd but reveal something important about how deeply exchange logic penetrates human relationships.

In the Buddhist tradition, *dāna* (generosity) is the first of the six *paramitas* (perfections) of the bodhisattva path. It begins with material giving but deepens into the giving of fearlessness (protecting others from danger) and the giving of the dharma (sharing wisdom). The highest generosity, in Buddhism, is given without attachment to giver, gift, or receiver — a practice of letting go that is both an ethical act and a step toward liberation from the self.
