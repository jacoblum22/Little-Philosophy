God is the concept of an ultimate, supreme being — the ground of existence, the source of morality, the creator of the cosmos — and the most debated idea in the history of human thought.

The arguments for God's existence are among philosophy's most famous constructions. The cosmological argument (everything has a cause, so there must be a first cause) dates back to Aristotle and was refined by Aquinas. The ontological argument (God is "that than which nothing greater can be conceived," and existence is greater than non-existence, so God must exist) has fascinated logicians since Anselm proposed it in the eleventh century. The design argument (the universe's order and complexity suggest an intelligent designer) remains popular today. Each argument has withstood centuries of criticism — and none has achieved universal acceptance.

The arguments against God are equally powerful. The problem of evil, perhaps the strongest, asks: if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good, why does suffering exist? A good God would want to prevent it, an all-knowing God would know how, and an all-powerful God would be able to. Yet children get cancer and earthquakes destroy cities. Theodicy — the attempt to reconcile God's goodness with the world's suffering — has produced many responses (free will, soul-making, mystery) but none that fully satisfies.

Non-Western conceptions of the divine often look very different. Brahman in Hindu philosophy is not a personal God but the impersonal ground of all being. The Dao in Daoist philosophy is not a being at all but the way things move. Buddhism largely sidesteps the question of God, considering it a distraction from the practical work of ending suffering. And within the monotheistic traditions, mystical currents (Sufism, Kabbalah, Christian mysticism) describe God not as a being among beings but as being itself — beyond every concept, including "God."

The question of God is not merely academic. What you believe about whether there's something ultimate behind reality shapes how you understand morality, meaning, death, and your place in the cosmos.
