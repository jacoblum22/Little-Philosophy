Grace is the gift that comes unearned and undeserved — the good that arrives not because you merited it but because something beyond you chose to give it.

In Christian theology, grace (gratia) is the central concept. Human beings, corrupted by original sin, cannot save themselves through their own efforts. Salvation comes only through God's free, unmerited gift — grace. Augustine argued that even the desire to turn toward God is itself a gift of grace: you don't choose God; God chooses you. This doctrine of prevenient grace (grace that comes before any human action) became foundational for centuries of Christian thought, though it creates a tension with free will that theologians have never fully resolved.

The Protestant Reformation was essentially a debate about grace. Luther argued for sola gratia (grace alone) — nothing you do can earn salvation. Calvin pushed further, arguing that God predestines some for salvation and others for damnation, and grace is given only to the elect. The Catholic position was more nuanced: grace is necessary but humans must cooperate with it through faith and works.

But grace is not exclusively Christian. In Hinduism, the concept of prasada (divine grace or favor) describes the gift that comes from devotion to God — a gift that bypasses the strict logic of karma. In Pure Land Buddhism, Amitabha Buddha's "other-power" (tariki) grants rebirth in the Pure Land to anyone who sincerely calls upon his name, regardless of merit. Even in secular contexts, we speak of graceful movement, a gracious host, or a grace period — moments where something flows naturally, generously, beyond what's strictly required.

The philosophical puzzle of grace is its relationship to justice. Justice gives you what you deserve; grace gives you what you don't deserve. Can both be right? If God (or anyone) simply forgives without consequence, is that mercy or the abandonment of justice?
