Guilt is the painful awareness that you have done something wrong — the inner judgment that you have violated a moral standard you yourself accept.

This self-directed moral pain has been analyzed from many angles. Freud located guilt in the superego — the internalized voice of parental and societal authority that punishes the ego for transgressing its rules. Guilt, in this view, is a psychological mechanism of social control: society programs guilt into you so that you police yourself. This explains why guilt so often exceeds the actual wrong done — the superego is harsh precisely because it doesn't need to be proportionate.

Nietzsche saw guilt as an invention of the priestly class, a weapon of "slave morality" used to tame the strong. The "bad conscience" arose when human aggression, which used to be directed outward, was turned inward by civilization. People who could no longer fight, conquer, or dominate began to torture themselves. Guilt, for Nietzsche, is the self-infliction of suffering — and its main function is to make people weak, compliant, and controllable.

But there's a case for guilt as morally valuable. Without it, how would we register the significance of our wrongdoing? A person who feels no guilt after betraying a friend or hurting a child has something missing — not missing psychologically but morally. Guilt, in its healthy form, is the signal that your actions have fallen short of your values. It's the discomfort that motivates repair: apology, restitution, changed behavior.

The distinction between guilt and shame is philosophically important. Guilt says "I did a bad thing"; shame says "I am a bad person." Guilt focuses on an action and can be resolved through repair. Shame attacks identity and is much harder to heal. Many cultures emphasize one over the other, with significant consequences for how moral failure is experienced and addressed.
