Habit is the tendency to repeat actions until they become automatic — until you do them without thinking. Philosophers have been fascinated by habit because it sits right at the boundary between freedom and mechanism: you chose the habit once, but now it seems to choose you.

Aristotle gave habit a central role in his ethics. Virtue, he argued, is not a feeling or a decision but a stable disposition — a habit of acting well. You become courageous by repeatedly doing courageous things, just as you become a good musician by repeatedly practicing. The habit eventually becomes "second nature," and the virtuous action that once required effort becomes something you do naturally and with pleasure. This is one of the most influential ideas in ethics: character is built through practice, not theory.

William James, the American pragmatist, called habit "the enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conservative agent." Habits keep society running because they allow people to function without having to deliberate about every action. But this also means habits can entrench bad patterns. James argued that habit formation follows physical laws — neural pathways that deepen with repetition — and urged young people to cultivate good habits early, before the "plaster" of character hardens.

The existentialists took a more suspicious view. For Heidegger, habitual ways of acting reflect "das Man" — the anonymous "they" that dictates how we live without our ever questioning it. Habit can be a form of sleepwalking, doing what's expected rather than what's authentically chosen. The philosophical challenge of habit is knowing which ones serve you and which ones have replaced your freedom with comfortable routine.
