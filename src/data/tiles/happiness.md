Happiness is what everyone wants and nobody agrees on — the most universal human aim and the most contested philosophical concept.

Ask ten philosophers what happiness is and you'll get twelve answers. That's because "happiness" can mean very different things: a fleeting feeling of pleasure, a lasting sense of satisfaction, a life well-lived, or even something that can only be judged after you're dead.

Aristotle's answer was the most influential. Happiness (*eudaimonia*) isn't a feeling — it's an activity. Specifically, it's the activity of living well and doing well, in accordance with virtue, over a complete life. You can't be happy in a moment; happiness is the shape of an entire life. And it requires external goods too — friends, health, moderate wealth. A person who is virtuous but crushed by misfortune isn't fully happy, no matter how good their character. This is more honest than most philosophical accounts, because it admits that happiness isn't entirely within your control.

The Epicureans disagreed: happiness is pleasure and the absence of pain — particularly mental pain (anxiety, fear, desire). But Epicurean pleasure isn't hedonistic indulgence. It's the calm satisfaction of a simple life with good friends and few needs. The greatest pleasure is *ataraxia* — tranquility, the absence of disturbance.

The Stoics went further: happiness is entirely within your control, because it depends only on virtue, which is a matter of will. External circumstances — wealth, health, even freedom — are "indifferent." A wise person can be happy on the rack. This is inspiring and demands a great deal of you.

The utilitarian tradition (Bentham, Mill) redefined happiness as pleasure minus pain and made it the measure of moral action: the right act is the one that produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number. But Mill insisted on distinguishing *higher* pleasures (intellectual, aesthetic) from lower ones (bodily). "It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."

Buddhist philosophy offers a counterpoint: the relentless pursuit of happiness *is* the problem. Craving pleasant experiences and resisting unpleasant ones is the engine of suffering (*dukkha*). Peace comes not from getting what you want but from wanting differently — or not wanting at all.

The honest truth is that happiness might be less like a destination and more like a byproduct: something that shows up when you're living well, connected to others, and engaged in something that matters.
