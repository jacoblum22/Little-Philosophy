Harm is the damage done to a person's well-being, interests, or rights — the negative impact of action (or inaction) on someone who matters morally.

John Stuart Mill made harm the foundation of liberal political philosophy with his harm principle: "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others." People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as they don't harm others. This sounds simple, but defining "harm" turns out to be enormously difficult. Does offensive speech harm people? Does environmental pollution? Does economic inequality?

Joel Feinberg distinguished several types of harm: physical harm to the body, harm to one's property or resources, harm to one's interests and opportunities, and (more controversially) harm to one's feelings or sensibilities. Each type raises different moral questions. Physical harm is the clearest case; harm to feelings is the most contested. If someone is deeply offended by your lifestyle, have you harmed them? Most liberal philosophers say no — offense is not harm — but the boundary is harder to draw than it looks.

The concept of harm by omission complicates things further. If you walk past a drowning child and do nothing, have you harmed the child? Common sense says yes, but the philosophical analysis is tricky: you haven't done anything to the child; you've just failed to help. Peter Singer has argued forcefully that the distinction between causing harm and failing to prevent it is morally irrelevant — which implies that affluent people who don't donate to famine relief are, in a meaningful sense, harming the starving.

In Indian philosophy, the principle of ahimsa (non-harm) extends beyond human beings to all living creatures, making harm avoidance the foundation of ethical life. The Jain tradition takes this to its most rigorous extreme, avoiding harm even to insects. How far the circle of moral concern should extend — and what counts as harm within that circle — remains an open and urgent question.
