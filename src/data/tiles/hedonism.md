Hedonism is the view that pleasure is the highest good — that the best life is the one containing the most pleasure and the least pain, and that all other values (knowledge, virtue, friendship) matter only insofar as they produce pleasure.

The ancient Cyrenaics (followers of Aristippus) held the most straightforward version: bodily pleasure right now is the only good. But Epicurus refined hedonism into something much more sophisticated. True pleasure, he argued, is not wild indulgence but ataraxia — a state of tranquil contentment, free from anxiety and unnecessary desire. The greatest pleasures are simple (friendship, philosophical conversation, bread and water when you're hungry), and the pursuit of luxury actually produces more pain than pleasure through the anxiety of maintaining and losing it. Epicurean hedonism is paradoxically ascetic.

Jeremy Bentham made hedonism the foundation of utilitarian ethics: the right action maximizes the total sum of pleasure minus pain across all affected individuals. He proposed quantifying pleasure along seven dimensions (intensity, duration, certainty, propinquity, fecundity, purity, extent). John Stuart Mill complicated this by arguing that some pleasures are qualitatively higher than others — the pleasures of the mind exceed the pleasures of the body, regardless of quantity.

Robert Nozick's "experience machine" thought experiment posed a powerful challenge: imagine a machine that could give you any pleasurable experience you wanted, indistinguishable from reality. Would you plug in? Most people say no — suggesting that we value something beyond pleasure: truth, authenticity, genuine achievement. If hedonism were correct, plugging in would be the obvious choice.

The hedonistic paradox adds another complication: the direct pursuit of pleasure often defeats itself. Happiness seems to come as a byproduct of meaningful activity, not from chasing happiness directly. The more you focus on maximizing pleasure, the less pleasure you tend to experience.
