Hermeneutics is the art and theory of interpretation — the philosophical discipline concerned with how we understand texts, people, cultures, and ultimately, anything that carries meaning.

The discipline began with the interpretation of sacred texts. How should you read the Bible? Literally? Allegorically? In light of historical context? These weren't just scholarly questions; they had life-or-death stakes during the Reformation, when wars were fought over the correct interpretation of Scripture.

Friedrich Schleiermacher transformed hermeneutics into a general theory of understanding. To understand a text, he argued, you need to reconstruct both the linguistic meaning (what the words mean in their language) and the psychological meaning (what the author intended). Understanding is an act of empathy — getting inside the mind of the author.

Gadamer rejected this. You can never fully reconstruct an author's intention, and attempting to do so misunderstands how interpretation works. Every reader brings their own "horizon" — their historical situation, prejudices, and expectations — to the text. Understanding happens not by erasing your horizon but through a "fusion of horizons" (Horizontverschmelzung): the text's world and your world meet, and something new emerges that neither the author nor the reader possessed in isolation. This means interpretation is never finished; each era reads the same text differently because each era brings a different horizon.

The hermeneutic circle captures a key insight: you can't understand the parts of a text without understanding the whole, and you can't understand the whole without understanding the parts. Understanding is circular, but not viciously so — each pass through the circle deepens both your grasp of the parts and the whole. This applies not just to texts but to understanding anything: a culture, a person, a historical event, a work of art.
