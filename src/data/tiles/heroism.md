Heroism is extraordinary action in the face of danger, suffering, or moral difficulty — going beyond what duty requires because something demands it. But the philosophical question is: what makes a hero, and should we want to be one?

The ancient Greeks had a complex relationship with heroism. Homer's heroes — Achilles, Odysseus, Hector — were defined by *aretē* (excellence) and *kleos* (glory). Their heroism was inseparable from pride, competition, and the desire for immortal fame. Aristotle admired the "great-souled man" who knows his own worth and acts accordingly. But Socrates offered a different model: the hero as truth-teller, someone whose courage is intellectual and moral rather than martial. His willingness to die rather than stop philosophizing was, in its own way, as heroic as anything on the battlefield.

Joseph Campbell's concept of the "hero's journey" — the monomyth found across world cultures — suggests that heroism follows a universal pattern: departure, initiation, return. The hero leaves the familiar world, faces trials, and returns transformed with knowledge or gifts for the community. This pattern appears in the Buddha's journey to enlightenment, in Moses leading the Israelites, in countless folk tales and religious narratives.

But modern thinkers have complicated heroism. Hannah Arendt worried about the cult of heroism in politics — the way it can be exploited by authoritarian movements. Feminist critics have noted how traditional heroism valorizes masculine traits (physical strength, individual glory) while devaluing feminine ones (care, solidarity, endurance). Perhaps the most radical rethinking comes from ordinary-person heroism research, which shows that heroes are not a special breed but ordinary people who, in a critical moment, choose to act.
