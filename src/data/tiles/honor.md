Honor is the value you hold in the eyes of your community — and, by extension, in your own eyes — based on living up to the standards that community recognizes. It's one of the oldest moral concepts, and one of the most contested.

In honor cultures, your worth is defined by your reputation. Ancient Greek *timē* (honor, standing) was the central concern of Homeric heroes — Achilles's rage in the *Iliad* is triggered by a slight to his honor, not by abstract moral principles. In many traditional societies, honor is collective rather than individual: your family, clan, or tribe shares in your honor, and a dishonor to one is a dishonor to all. This is why slights can escalate so quickly in honor cultures — what's at stake is not just personal pride but communal identity.

The Enlightenment challenged honor in favor of dignity — the idea that every person has inherent worth regardless of social standing or reputation. Kant argued that morality is about universal duty, not about what others think of you. This shift from honor to dignity is, in many ways, the story of modern moral thought. Dignity says: you have worth because you're human. Honor says: you have worth because you've earned it.

But honor hasn't disappeared. Military codes, professional ethics, and even informal social norms still operate on honor principles. Kwame Anthony Appiah has argued that moral revolutions — the abolition of dueling, foot-binding, slavery — often happened not because people discovered new moral arguments but because the practices became *dishonorable*. Honor might be philosophically messy, but it remains a powerful motivator that pure reason alone has trouble replacing.
