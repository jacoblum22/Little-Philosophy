Hope is the expectation that something good is possible — not certain, not even probable, but genuinely possible — combined with the desire for it to happen.

This makes hope different from both optimism and wishing. Optimism says things will turn out well; hope says they might turn out well, and it matters to keep acting as though they could. Wishing is passive; hope is active — it sustains effort in the face of uncertainty. Václav Havel captured this: "Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out."

In the Greek tradition, hope was ambiguous. When Pandora opened her jar and released all evils into the world, hope (elpis) remained inside. Was this a comfort — the one good thing left? Or was hope itself a kind of evil — the delusion that keeps you enduring rather than acting? The Greeks weren't sure, and the debate continues.

Christian theology elevated hope to a theological virtue alongside faith and charity. To hope, in this tradition, is to trust that God's promises will be fulfilled — even when everything visible contradicts them. The Book of Romans says "hope that is seen is not hope," emphasizing that hope only exists in conditions of uncertainty. Ernst Bloch, a Marxist philosopher, secularized this: he described hope as the fundamental human orientation toward the "not yet" — the unfinished possibilities that lie ahead. For Bloch, every utopian impulse, every revolutionary movement, every act of imagination is powered by hope.

The philosophical challenge of hope is knowing when it's warranted. Hope can sustain people through genuine suffering. But false hope can also prevent them from facing reality, leaving unjust situations, or grieving properly. Is hope a virtue or a vulnerability? The answer may depend on what — and how — you hope for.
