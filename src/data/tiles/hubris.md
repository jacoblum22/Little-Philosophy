Hubris is the excessive pride that makes you forget your limits — and the ancient Greek warning about what happens when you do.

In Greek tragedy, hubris is the sin that triggers catastrophe. Oedipus believes he can outsmart his fate. Agamemnon walks on the purple carpet meant for the gods. Icarus flies too close to the sun. In every case, the pattern is the same: a mortal overreaches, crosses a boundary between the human and the divine, and the universe corrects the transgression — brutally.

But hubris isn't just arrogance. It's a specific kind of blindness: the inability to see yourself as subject to the same limits as everyone else. Aristotle defined it as treating others with contempt to demonstrate your own superiority — humiliating someone not for any practical reason but purely for the pleasure of domination. It's the opposite of the moderation (*sophrosyne*) that Greek ethics prized.

The concept carries a deep metaphysical assumption: that the order of things includes limits on human ambition, and that violating those limits invites *nemesis* — not just punishment but cosmic rebalancing. The universe, in this view, has a structure, and that structure doesn't tolerate beings who think they're above it.

Nietzsche complicated this picture. What the Greeks called hubris, Nietzsche sometimes saw as the highest form of human striving — the willingness to push beyond established boundaries, to create new values, to refuse comfort. Is it hubris to attempt the impossible, or is it the source of everything genuinely new?

In contemporary life, hubris shows up everywhere: in leaders who believe their own propaganda, in tech moguls who think they can engineer human nature, in civilizations that treat the planet as an inexhaustible resource. The Greek tragedians would recognize every case. Their lesson wasn't "don't be ambitious." It was "remember what you are."
