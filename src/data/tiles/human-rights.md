Human rights are the basic entitlements that every person possesses simply by being human — rights that cannot be taken away by any government, culture, or circumstance.

The philosophical foundation is contested. Natural rights theory (Locke, Jefferson) holds that rights are inherent in human nature, discoverable by reason, and prior to any government. The state doesn't grant rights; it recognizes and protects them. If it fails, citizens may revolt. This tradition produced the American Declaration of Independence ("endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights") and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), drafted in the aftermath of the Holocaust, attempted to create a universal standard: rights to life, liberty, security, education, freedom of thought, freedom from torture. Its philosophical ambition was enormous — to establish principles that hold across every culture, religion, and political system.

But universality is exactly what critics challenge. Cultural relativists argue that "human rights" as defined in the UDHR reflect Western liberal values and cannot be imposed on societies with different traditions. Are individual rights more fundamental than communal responsibilities? Is freedom of expression more important than social harmony? Islamic scholars have proposed alternative frameworks grounded in Sharia; Confucian thinkers have emphasized duties over rights; African philosophers have grounded human dignity in community (ubuntu) rather than individual autonomy.

The utilitarian critique is different: Jeremy Bentham called natural rights "nonsense upon stilts." Rights, he argued, are not natural but legal — they exist only when a legal system creates and enforces them. Asserting a "natural right" is just expressing a wish in emphatic language.

Despite these critiques, human rights remain the most widely accepted moral framework on Earth — invoked by liberation movements, encoded in international law, and violated by every government that claims to uphold them.
