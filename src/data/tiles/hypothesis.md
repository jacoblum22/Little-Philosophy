A hypothesis is a proposed explanation for something — a tentative answer to a question, put forward not as established truth but as a claim to be tested against evidence.

The concept is central to the scientific method. You observe something puzzling, propose an explanation (the hypothesis), deduce what would have to be true if the hypothesis were correct, and then check whether those predictions hold up. If they do, the hypothesis is supported (but not proven); if they don't, the hypothesis is falsified and must be revised or abandoned.

Karl Popper made falsifiability the defining feature of scientific hypotheses. A claim that can't conceivably be proven wrong isn't a scientific hypothesis at all — it's either a tautology or a pseudoscientific claim disguised as science. "All swans are white" is a good hypothesis because it can be falsified (find one black swan). "The universe was created by an invisible being whose actions are undetectable" is not, because no evidence could count against it. Popper's criterion was meant to demarcate science from non-science, though the boundary has proved harder to draw than he hoped.

The history of science is littered with beautiful hypotheses that turned out to be wrong: the phlogiston theory of combustion, the luminiferous ether, the steady-state universe. But failed hypotheses aren't wasted — they clarify what the truth is not, narrowing the range of possibilities. As Isaac Asimov noted, the most exciting phrase in science isn't "Eureka!" but "That's funny..."

Philosophically, the concept of hypothesis raises the question of underdetermination: the same evidence can usually support more than one hypothesis. How do you choose between them? Simplicity (Occam's razor), explanatory power, and coherence with other knowledge all play roles — but none is decisive, and the possibility that the "right" hypothesis hasn't been conceived yet can never be ruled out.
