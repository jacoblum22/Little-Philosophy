Idealism is the philosophical position that reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual — that ideas, minds, or consciousness are more basic than matter. It's the mirror image of materialism, and despite sounding counterintuitive, it has been one of the most influential positions in the history of philosophy.

Plato is the grandfather of idealism: he argued that the physical world is a shadow of a higher realm of perfect, eternal Forms. The chair you sit in is an imperfect copy of the Form of Chair; the justice you see in the world is a dim reflection of the Form of Justice. True knowledge is knowledge of the Forms, not of physical things. This Platonic idealism shaped Western thought for two millennia.

George Berkeley pushed idealism in a radical direction: physical objects don't exist independently of being perceived. "To be is to be perceived" (*esse est percipi*). The tree in the forest when no one is looking? It exists because God perceives it. Berkeley wasn't denying that tables and chairs are real; he was arguing that their reality is mental through and through.

German Idealism — Hegel, Schelling, Fichte — is the most ambitious version. Hegel argued that all of reality is the unfolding of "Absolute Spirit" (*Geist*) coming to know itself through history. Everything that happens — every war, revolution, philosophical argument — is part of Spirit's journey toward self-awareness. This sounds mystical, but Hegel's method (dialectic: thesis, antithesis, synthesis) became enormously influential, including on Marx, who "turned Hegel on his head" by replacing Spirit with material economic forces. Whether you're a materialist or an idealist, the debate forces you to confront the deepest question: what is the fundamental nature of reality?
