Identity is the answer to the question "who are you?" — the set of characteristics, beliefs, memories, and social roles that make you the particular person you are.

But the question is harder than it looks. Are you the same person you were ten years ago? Your cells have been replaced, your beliefs may have changed, your relationships are different. The Ship of Theseus — the ancient Greek thought experiment about replacing every plank of a ship until none of the original remains — asks the same question about objects, but the personal version hits closer to home. What makes you "you" over time?

Philosophers have proposed different answers. John Locke argued that personal identity is based on memory: you are the same person as long as you remember being that person. But this has problems — you don't remember being a baby, yet you were presumably the same person then. David Hume went further and argued that there is no unified self at all, just a bundle of perceptions succeeding each other. Derek Parfit updated this view, arguing that personal identity isn't what matters — what matters is psychological continuity, which comes in degrees.

Then there's the social dimension. Your identity isn't formed in isolation — it's shaped by your culture, language, gender, race, class, and the expectations others place on you. Simone de Beauvoir showed how gender identity is constructed rather than given. Charles Taylor argued that identity requires "recognition" — that who you are depends partly on how others see you. And thinkers from Fanon to Said have explored how colonial power shapes the identities of the colonized. The question of identity sits at the crossroads of metaphysics, psychology, and politics — and it's never fully settled.
