Identity is the question that arises when the self meets society: who am I, and how much of "me" is shaped by the world around me? Am I the same person I was ten years ago? Would I be a different person if I'd been born in a different time or place?

Philosophers have wrestled with identity from many angles. Personal identity asks what makes you "you" over time — is it your body, your memories, your consciousness? Social identity asks how much of who you are comes from your culture, language, gender, or class. Existentialists like Sartre argued that we aren't born with a fixed identity — we create ourselves through our choices. "Existence precedes essence," he said — you exist first, and only then define who you are.
