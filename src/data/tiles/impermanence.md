Impermanence is the truth that everything changes — everything. Your body, your thoughts, your relationships, the stars themselves. Nothing lasts.

This sounds obvious, but most of human suffering comes from acting as though it isn't true. We cling to pleasure, hoping it will last. We resist pain, hoping it will stop. We build identities, institutions, and monuments designed to endure. And all of them, eventually, don't. Impermanence is the philosophical reality that most people spend their lives trying to outrun.

In Buddhist philosophy, impermanence (*anicca*) is one of the Three Marks of Existence, alongside suffering (*dukkha*) and non-self (*anatta*). These three are intimately connected: because everything is impermanent, attachment to it causes suffering, and the "self" we cling to is itself a changing process rather than a fixed thing. The Buddha didn't teach impermanence as a depressing truth — he taught it as a liberating one. When you truly understand that nothing lasts, you stop gripping so tightly, and a lot of unnecessary suffering falls away.

Heraclitus, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, arrived at a similar insight: *panta rhei* — "everything flows." You can't step into the same river twice, because both the river and you have changed. Reality is not made of stable things but of processes, patterns, and constant transformation.

Japanese aesthetics built entire worldviews around impermanence. *Mono no aware* — "the pathos of things" — is the bittersweet emotional response to the transience of beauty. Cherry blossoms are beautiful *because* they fall. *Wabi-sabi* finds beauty in imperfection, incompleteness, and decay. These aren't consolation prizes for mortality — they're expressions of a deep metaphysical truth: impermanence isn't a flaw to be overcome; it's the texture of reality itself.

Western philosophy has generally resisted this view. Plato's Forms, Aristotle's essences, Christianity's eternal soul, modern science's search for unchanging laws — all reflect a deep desire for permanence underneath the change. The philosophical question impermanence forces is: what if permanence is the illusion, and change is all there is? And if so, can you find peace in that?
