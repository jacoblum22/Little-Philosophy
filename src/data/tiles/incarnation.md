Incarnation literally means "becoming flesh" — the idea that something immaterial (a spirit, a god, a principle) takes on physical bodily form. It's a concept that appears across religious traditions, and it raises profound philosophical questions about the relationship between the spiritual and the physical.

In Christianity, the Incarnation refers specifically to the belief that God became human in the person of Jesus Christ. This is not just a divine being wearing a human disguise — orthodox Christian theology insists that Christ was fully God *and* fully human, two complete natures united in one person. The early church councils (Nicaea, Chalcedon) spent centuries debating exactly how to articulate this, producing some of the most intellectually demanding theology in history. The philosophical stakes were enormous: if God can become material, then matter is not opposed to spirit but capable of bearing it.

In Hinduism, the concept of *avatarā* describes the descent of a deity (especially Vishnu) into earthly form. Vishnu incarnates as Rama, as Krishna, as the Buddha, to restore cosmic order (*dharma*) when it's threatened. Unlike the Christian incarnation, which is unique and unrepeatable, Hindu avatars are multiple — God takes on whatever form the situation requires.

Philosophically, incarnation challenges dualism — the strict separation of mind and body, spirit and matter. If the divine can become flesh, the body is not a prison but a medium of revelation. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the body, while not theological, makes a structurally similar point: we don't *have* bodies; we *are* bodies. Consciousness is always embodied, always "incarnate." The philosophical and theological traditions converge on the insight that the split between spiritual and physical is not as clean as it seems.
