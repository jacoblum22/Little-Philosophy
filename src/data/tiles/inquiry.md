Inquiry is the deliberate pursuit of understanding — the systematic effort to move from not-knowing to knowing, from confusion to clarity, from questions to answers (and often to better questions).

Socrates made inquiry a way of life. His method (the elenchus) was not to teach people what he knew but to ask questions that exposed what they didn't know. Do you know what justice is? Let's examine your answer. Does it hold up under scrutiny? If not, let's try again. The Socratic method proceeds by refutation: each proposed answer is tested until it fails, pushing the inquiry deeper. Socrates believed this process was valuable not despite its inconclusiveness but because of it — recognizing your own ignorance is the beginning of wisdom.

Aristotle systematized inquiry into a method. He began with observation, proceeded through organized puzzlement (aporia), and arrived at explanatory principles. His approach combined careful attention to phenomena with logical analysis — a balance that science would eventually inherit. The key insight: inquiry requires both curiosity (the desire to know) and discipline (the patience to investigate properly).

John Dewey transformed the concept for the modern era. Inquiry, he argued, is not an abstract search for truth but a practical response to a felt difficulty. We inquire when something goes wrong, when our habits are disrupted, when the situation becomes problematic. Inquiry begins with uncertainty and aims at the resolution of doubt — not absolute certainty but "warranted assertibility." This pragmatist vision makes inquiry continuous with everyday problem-solving.

The deepest question about inquiry is whether it has limits. Are there questions that honest inquiry cannot answer? Mystical traditions often say yes: the deepest truths are not found through investigation but through surrender, silence, or direct experience. Whether this is a genuine limit or a failure of nerve is one of the things we can't stop inquiring about.
