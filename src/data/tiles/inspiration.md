Inspiration is the experience of being moved to create or to see something anew — a sudden influx of insight, energy, or vision that seems to come from beyond yourself. The word literally means "breathing in," and for most of history, people treated it as something that happened *to* you rather than something you did.

The Greeks attributed inspiration to the Muses — divine beings who "breathed into" poets and artists. Plato, in the *Ion*, described the poet as someone who loses rational control during creation, becoming a channel for divine utterance. This "divine madness" was both praised and distrusted: praised because it produced extraordinary work, distrusted because it bypassed reason. Plato's ambivalence about inspiration mirrors a deeper tension in his thought between the rational and the ecstatic.

The Romantics embraced inspiration wholeheartedly. For poets like Coleridge and Shelley, inspiration was the mark of genius — an encounter with the sublime that could not be manufactured or mechanized. Coleridge's famous account of composing *Kubla Khan* in an opium-induced vision (interrupted, tragically, by "a person from Porlock") became the archetypal story of inspiration lost.

But other traditions are more pragmatic. The Islamic concept of *ilham* (divine inspiration) is distinguished from *wahy* (prophetic revelation) — ordinary people can receive *ilham* through spiritual practice and moral purification. In the Confucian tradition, inspiration comes not from divine madness but from diligent study and practice that eventually produces a breakthrough understanding. The philosophical question remains: is inspiration a gift you receive, a skill you cultivate, or some mysterious combination of the two?
