Integrity means being whole — having your actions, beliefs, and values aligned so that you are the same person in private as in public, under pressure as in comfort. The word shares its root with "integer": something undivided.

The simplest account of integrity is honesty: saying what you mean and doing what you say. But philosophers have pushed deeper. Bernard Williams argued that integrity is about having commitments so fundamental that abandoning them would mean losing yourself. When a utilitarian calculation tells you to betray your deepest principles for the greater good, something important is at stake — not just your feelings but your identity as a moral agent. Integrity, on this view, is the refusal to become someone you don't recognize.

But integrity can't just mean stubbornness. A person who rigidly holds terrible beliefs has a kind of consistency, but we wouldn't call it admirable. Cheshire Calhoun argues that integrity requires not just personal consistency but responsiveness to moral reality — being someone who stands for something worth standing for. This connects integrity to moral courage: it takes guts to maintain your principles when doing so is costly.

Confucian thought captures something similar with the concept of *cheng* (sincerity or authenticity) — the idea that a person of virtue is transparent, that their inner life and outer conduct form a seamless whole. The *Doctrine of the Mean* describes *cheng* as the way of Heaven itself: reality without pretense. Integrity, in this tradition, isn't just a personal virtue but an alignment with the order of things.
