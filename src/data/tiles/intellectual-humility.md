Intellectual humility is the recognition that your beliefs might be wrong — that your knowledge has limits, your perspective is partial, and your reasoning is fallible. It's not self-doubt or lack of confidence; it's the calibration of confidence to evidence.

Socrates modeled intellectual humility for all of Western philosophy. The Oracle at Delphi declared him the wisest person in Athens, and he concluded this must be because he alone knew that he didn't know. His relentless questioning of others wasn't arrogance but a demonstration that confident experts often know less than they think. Socratic humility is not modesty — it's a fierce commitment to not pretending to know what you don't.

In epistemology, intellectual humility connects to the question of how we should hold our beliefs. Bayesian reasoning suggests we should assign probabilities to our beliefs and update them as evidence comes in. The intellectually humble person holds their beliefs firmly enough to act on them but loosely enough to revise them when they encounter good reasons to do so. This is harder than it sounds: psychological research shows that humans are prone to confirmation bias (seeking evidence for what they already believe) and the Dunning-Kruger effect (the least competent being the most confident).

Intellectual humility has become a topic of serious study in virtue epistemology — the branch of philosophy that asks what intellectual character traits make for a good thinker. Alongside open-mindedness, thoroughness, and intellectual courage, humility is increasingly seen as essential for genuine learning, productive disagreement, and democratic discourse. In an age of polarization and misinformation, the ability to say "I might be wrong" may be the most important intellectual skill there is.
