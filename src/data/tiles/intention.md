Intention is the mental state of meaning to do something — the purpose behind an action. In ethics, it's one of the most important and contested factors in moral evaluation: does what you meant to do matter as much as (or more than) what actually happened?

Kant made intention the foundation of morality. Only actions done from the right intention — from duty, out of respect for the moral law — have genuine moral worth. A shopkeeper who gives honest change only because it's good for business isn't acting morally, even though the outcome is the same as if they were. It's the "good will" behind the action that makes it good. This is a powerful intuition: we naturally judge a well-intentioned mistake differently from a malicious success.

Consequentialists disagree. If your intentions are wonderful but the results are catastrophic, what good are your intentions? Utilitarians argue that what matters is the outcome — the net happiness or suffering produced — not the mental state of the agent. A road paved with good intentions still leads where it leads.

In law, intention (*mens rea*) is crucial: the difference between murder and manslaughter is largely about whether you intended to kill. In Islamic ethics, the hadith "Actions are judged by intentions" (*innamal a'malu bin niyyat*) is foundational. In Buddhist ethics, *cetana* (intention or volition) is what creates karma — not the physical action itself, but the mental state behind it. Across traditions, the philosophical question is the same: is morality primarily about what's inside your head or what happens in the world?
