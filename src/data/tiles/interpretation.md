Interpretation is the act of making sense of something — a text, an action, a symbol, a situation — that doesn't simply announce its own meaning. It's the bridge between what's given and what's understood, and it turns out to be far more complex than it first appears.

Hermeneutics, the philosophical study of interpretation, began with biblical exegesis: how do you determine the true meaning of scripture? Friedrich Schleiermacher expanded it to all texts, arguing that interpretation requires reconstructing the author's intention and the historical context. Wilhelm Dilthey went further, proposing hermeneutics as the method for all the human sciences (*Geisteswissenschaften*) — because unlike natural objects, human creations have meaning that must be interpreted, not just observed.

Hans-Georg Gadamer revolutionized the field by arguing that interpretation is never neutral. You always bring your own "horizon" — your assumptions, experiences, and historical situation — to every act of understanding. Rather than seeing this as a distortion to be eliminated, Gadamer saw it as the condition of understanding: meaning emerges in the "fusion of horizons" between text and reader, past and present. You can't understand the *Republic* the way Plato's original audience did, but the conversation across time produces new and genuine understanding.

Derrida took this further with deconstruction, arguing that meaning is never fully stable — every text contains tensions, ambiguities, and contradictions that undermine its apparent coherence. This isn't a cynical attack on meaning but an insistence that texts are always richer and stranger than any single interpretation can capture. Interpretation is never complete; there's always more to say.
