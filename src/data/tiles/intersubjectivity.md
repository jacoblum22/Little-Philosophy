Intersubjectivity is the shared space of understanding between conscious beings — the fact that your experience and mine can meet, overlap, and create a common world. It solves (or at least addresses) the problem of solipsism: how do I know other minds exist, and how can we share meaning?

Husserl introduced intersubjectivity as a central problem of phenomenology. If philosophy starts from first-person experience (as Descartes and Husserl both insisted), how do you get from "I" to "we"? Husserl argued that we experience others through "empathic apperception" — perceiving another body as an experiencing subject like ourselves. But this account was criticized as too intellectual: do we really infer the existence of other minds, or is our awareness of others more immediate than that?

Heidegger argued that we're always already "being-with" (*Mitsein*) — human existence is fundamentally social, not solitary. We don't start as isolated subjects who then discover other minds; we start in a shared world of practices, tools, and language. Merleau-Ponty explored how intersubjectivity is rooted in the body: a baby imitates a smile before she can reason about other minds, because bodily understanding precedes intellectual understanding.

Levinas took intersubjectivity in an ethical direction: the encounter with the Other — the face that confronts you and demands a response — is the foundation of all ethics. Before you can theorize about morality, you have already been addressed by another being whose vulnerability makes a claim on you. Intersubjectivity, for Levinas, is not primarily a problem to be solved but a responsibility to be honored.
