Intuition is knowing something without being able to explain how you know it — a direct grasp of truth that bypasses the slow, step-by-step process of reasoning.

You've felt it. You meet someone and instantly sense they can't be trusted. You stare at a math problem and the answer arrives in a flash, before you can work through the proof. You make a split-second decision that turns out to be exactly right. Where did that knowledge come from? You can't trace the reasoning because there wasn't any — at least not consciously.

Western philosophy has had an uneasy relationship with intuition. Plato described a kind of intellectual intuition — a direct vision of the Forms that goes beyond ordinary reasoning. Descartes claimed that certain truths (like "I think, therefore I am") are known by intuition rather than deduction. Kant gave intuition (Anschauung) a technical role: it's the faculty through which objects are presented to the mind. But the empiricist tradition has generally been suspicious, viewing intuition as unreliable — a feeling masquerading as knowledge.

Other traditions are far more welcoming. In Zen Buddhism, satori — sudden enlightenment — is precisely an intuitive breakthrough, a direct seeing that can't be reached by thinking. Hindu philosophy speaks of prajna, a wisdom that transcends rational analysis. Indigenous knowledge systems often value intuitive understanding gained through long relationship with the land, animals, and seasonal patterns. The question isn't whether intuition exists — everyone experiences it — but whether it's a legitimate source of knowledge, or just pattern recognition dressed up as insight.
