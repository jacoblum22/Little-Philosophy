Justice is what emerges when empathy meets questioning — when you feel the weight of others' experiences and start asking: is this fair? Why do some people suffer while others flourish? What would a truly just world look like?

Justice is one of the oldest and most contested concepts in philosophy. Plato devoted his greatest work, The Republic, to the question "What is justice?" Aristotle distinguished between distributive justice (fair sharing), corrective justice (making wrongs right), and commutative justice (fair exchange). In modern philosophy, John Rawls asked what principles of justice people would choose if they didn't know their place in society — his "veil of ignorance" thought experiment remains one of the most influential ideas in political philosophy.
