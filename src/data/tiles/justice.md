Justice is the deep human concern with fairness — the persistent question of whether things are as they should be. Why do some people suffer while others flourish? What would a truly fair world look like? What do we owe each other?

Justice is one of the oldest and most contested concepts in philosophy. Plato devoted his greatest work, The Republic, to the question "What is justice?" Aristotle distinguished between distributive justice (fair sharing), corrective justice (making wrongs right), and commutative justice (fair exchange). In modern philosophy, John Rawls asked what principles of justice people would choose if they didn't know their place in society — his "veil of ignorance" thought experiment remains one of the most influential ideas in political philosophy.
