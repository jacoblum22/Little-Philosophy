Justice is the answer to the question: what do people owe each other?

It's one of the oldest and most contested concepts in philosophy. Plato devoted his longest dialogue, the *Republic*, to it — and the answer he arrived at (a rigidly stratified city run by philosopher-kings) has been debated ever since. The question sounds political, and it is. But it's also deeply personal. Every time you feel that something is unfair, every time you're outraged by cruelty or moved by someone getting what they deserve, you're making a judgment about justice.

Plato's Thrasymachus offered the cynical answer: justice is whatever benefits the powerful. Laws are made by rulers to serve their own interests, and "justice" is just a pretty word for obedience. Socrates pushed back, arguing that justice is good in itself — that a just person is happier than an unjust one, regardless of rewards or punishments. This remains one of the hardest claims in philosophy to prove.

Aristotle distinguished between distributive justice (how goods should be shared across a community) and corrective justice (how wrongs should be righted between individuals). His key principle was proportionality: equals should be treated equally, and unequals unequally in proportion to their relevant differences. The difficulty, of course, is deciding which differences are "relevant."

Modern political philosophy was transformed by John Rawls's *A Theory of Justice* (1971). Rawls asked: what principles would rational people choose if they didn't know their own position in society — their class, race, gender, talents, or disabilities? Behind this "veil of ignorance," Rawls argued, they would choose two principles: equal basic liberties for all, and economic inequalities only if they benefit the worst-off members of society. This thought experiment made fairness the foundation of justice.

But Rawls has critics on every side. Libertarians like Nozick argue that justice is about respecting property rights and voluntary exchange, not redistributing wealth. Communitarians argue that abstract principles can't replace the shared traditions and values of actual communities. Feminist philosophers of care argue that justice's focus on rights and rules misses the relational dimension of moral life. And postcolonial thinkers point out that the very framework of "universal" justice often reflects particular Western assumptions.

Justice may be the most important concept in philosophy — and the one we're least likely to agree on.
