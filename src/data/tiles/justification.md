Justification is the "why" behind a belief — the reasons, evidence, or warrant that make a belief rational rather than merely lucky or arbitrary. In epistemology, justification is one of the three traditional requirements for knowledge: a belief must be true, you must believe it, and you must be justified in believing it.

But what makes a belief justified? This question has generated centuries of debate. **Foundationalism** says justification rests on basic beliefs that are self-evident or grounded in experience — like a building resting on a foundation. **Coherentism** says beliefs are justified in virtue of fitting together in a coherent web — like a raft floating on water, each plank supporting the others. **Reliabilism** shifts the focus from reasons to processes: a belief is justified if it was produced by a reliable process (like vision in good light), regardless of whether you can articulate why.

Edmund Gettier famously showed in 1963 that justified true belief isn't sufficient for knowledge. In his thought experiments, a person has a justified belief that happens to be true, but it's true by accident rather than because of the justification. You believe your coworker owns a Ford because he told you so and you've seen him driving one, but actually he sold the Ford yesterday and just happens to be renting one today. Your belief is justified and true, but it doesn't seem like knowledge. The "Gettier problem" has generated a small industry of philosophical responses and remains unsolved.

Outside epistemology, justification appears in ethics (can you justify your actions?), politics (what justifies the state's authority?), and theology (justification by faith — how a sinner is made right before God). In every domain, the core question is the same: what makes something count as a good enough reason?
