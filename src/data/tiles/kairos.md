*Kairos* (καιρός) is the Greek concept of the "right moment" — qualitative time as opposed to *chronos*, which is merely quantitative (the steady tick of the clock). Kairos is the opportune instant when conditions align, when action becomes possible, when a door opens that won't stay open forever.

The Greeks personified Kairos as a young man with a lock of hair on his forehead and a bald head behind — you can grasp him as he approaches, but once he's passed, there's nothing to hold on to. This image captures the essence of kairos: it must be seized in the moment or lost forever. Aristotle discussed kairos in rhetoric — the effective speaker knows not just *what* to say but *when* to say it. The same argument delivered at the wrong moment falls flat.

In Christian theology, kairos took on eschatological significance. Paul used it to describe the "fullness of time" in which God acts decisively in history — the moment of Christ's coming, the moment of judgment. Kairos here is not just opportunity but destiny: the moment when eternity breaks into time.

Existentialists echoed the concept without always using the word. Heidegger's notion of the "moment of vision" (*Augenblick*) — the instant when Dasein seizes its own authentic possibilities instead of drifting along in everyday existence — is essentially kairos in existentialist dress. The philosophical insight is that not all moments are equal. Some moments are pregnant with possibility, and wisdom consists partly in recognizing them when they come and having the courage to act.
