Karma is the principle that your actions have consequences — not just in the ordinary sense, but woven into the fabric of the universe itself.

The word comes from Sanskrit *karman*, meaning "action" or "deed." In its original context, karma isn't about cosmic punishment or reward — it's closer to a natural law, like gravity. Drop a ball and it falls. Act with cruelty and suffering follows. Act with compassion and well-being follows. Not because someone is keeping score, but because that's how reality works.

In Hinduism, karma accumulates across lifetimes. Your actions in this life — and in previous ones — shape the conditions of your next birth. Good karma (*punya*) leads to favorable rebirth; bad karma (*papa*) leads to suffering. The caste system was historically justified through karma: your birth station reflects your past-life actions. This interpretation has been rightly criticized as a tool of oppression — it can turn systemic injustice into individual blame. But the metaphysical core of the idea — that actions matter, that consequences are inescapable — remains philosophically powerful.

Buddhism transformed karma significantly. The Buddha shifted attention from the outward act to the *intention* behind it. It's not just what you do but *why* you do it that generates karma. A compassionate act performed with genuine kindness has different karmic weight than the same act performed for selfish reasons. Buddhist karma operates through dependent origination: every action sets in motion a chain of causes and effects that ripple outward indefinitely.

Jainism developed the most elaborate metaphysics of karma. Karma is literally physical — subtle particles of matter that attach to the soul (*jīva*) through action, especially violent action. Liberation requires burning off this accumulated karmic matter through ascetic practice.

In the West, the idea of moral causation appears in different forms — "you reap what you sow," the Greek concept of *nemesis*, the notion that the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice. Whether karma is a literal cosmic mechanism or a profound metaphor for the way consequences accumulate, it captures something most people intuit: that what you do matters, and not just for the obvious reasons.
