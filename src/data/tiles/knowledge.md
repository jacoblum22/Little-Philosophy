Knowledge is more than true belief — it's true belief with good reasons. It goes beyond merely seeing something; it requires thinking carefully about what you've seen and arriving at justified understanding.

Epistemology, the branch of philosophy devoted to knowledge, asks three fundamental questions: What can we know? How do we know it? And what counts as genuine knowledge versus mere opinion? Plato defined knowledge as "justified true belief" — a definition philosophers have debated for over two thousand years. The problem is that justification itself is slippery: every justification rests on further assumptions, which rest on further assumptions, leading to an infinite regress. How do we get off the merry-go-round? Different philosophers have tried different exits — foundationalism, coherentism, pragmatism — and the debate continues.
