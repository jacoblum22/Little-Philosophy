Language is the system of symbols — spoken, written, or signed — through which human beings communicate, think, and construct their shared world.

Philosophy's relationship with language is peculiar: philosophy is done in language, but it also questions what language is, how it works, and whether it can be trusted. Plato worried that words are mere imitations of reality, two steps removed from the Forms. The Daoists went further: "The Dao that can be spoken is not the true Dao." If the deepest truths are beyond words, then philosophy — which works in words — faces a fundamental limit.

The twentieth century saw a "linguistic turn" in Western philosophy. Wittgenstein argued in his early work that language pictures reality: the structure of a meaningful sentence mirrors the structure of a possible fact. In his later work, he changed his mind entirely: language doesn't picture anything — it's a set of "language games," each with its own rules, played within forms of life. Meaning is not a matter of words matching things but of words being used in context.

The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests that language doesn't just express thought but shapes it: speakers of different languages literally perceive the world differently. While the strong version (language determines thought) is generally rejected, the weak version (language influences thought) has considerable evidence. The Hopi language has no past tense; Mandarin uses spatial metaphors for time that English doesn't. Do these differences create different experiences of time?

In the Indian tradition, the grammarian Bhartrhari argued that language (shabda) is the fundamental reality — that the world is constituted by the creative power of speech (shabda-brahman). This reverses the usual Western assumption that reality comes first and language merely describes it. Perhaps we don't use language to talk about the world; perhaps language is what makes a world possible.
