Law is the system of rules a society creates to govern conduct — and the perennial philosophical question is whether those rules merely reflect power or genuinely embody justice.

The natural law tradition, stretching from Aristotle through Aquinas to Martin Luther King Jr., holds that human law derives its authority from a higher moral law. A statute that violates natural justice — a law mandating slavery, say — is not truly a law at all. This view gives citizens grounds to resist unjust legislation: if the law on the books contradicts the moral law, the moral law wins.

Legal positivism, championed by thinkers like Bentham, Austin, and H.L.A. Hart, rejects this. Law is whatever the recognized legal authorities of a society have enacted according to established procedures. Whether a law is *just* is a separate question from whether it is *law*. You can criticize an unjust law, campaign to change it, even break it in protest — but you can't deny that it is law. The danger of natural law theory, positivists argue, is that it lets people substitute their own moral convictions for the rule of law.

The debate became urgently practical in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Nazi laws were enacted through legally valid procedures. Were they "law"? If yes, then law and morality can radically diverge. If no, then the legal positivists are wrong. The Nuremberg trials grappled with this directly, and the legacy continues in international human rights law, which attempts to establish legal norms that override national sovereignty.

Marx offered a different critique: law is ideology. Legal systems present themselves as neutral arbiters, but they systematically protect the interests of the ruling class. Property law protects those who have property. Contract law assumes equal bargaining power that doesn't exist. The "rule of law" masks the rule of the powerful.

The deepest question about law is whether it can be more than organized force — whether it can genuinely aspire to justice, or whether that aspiration is always, at bottom, a noble fiction.
