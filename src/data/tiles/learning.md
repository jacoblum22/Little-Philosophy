Learning is the process by which experience becomes understanding — the transformation of raw encounters with the world into knowledge, skills, and insight.

We learn constantly, often without realizing it. A child touching a hot stove learns about cause and effect. A student struggling with a proof learns about logical structure. A person who has been betrayed learns about trust. But what exactly happens when we learn? Is learning just accumulating information, like filling a bucket? Or is it something more active — restructuring the way you see the world?

Plato proposed a radical answer: learning is really remembering. The soul, he argued, already knows everything — birth into a physical body just makes us forget. Education is the process of recovering what we already possess. Aristotle was more empirical: we learn by doing, by forming habits, by practicing until the right response becomes second nature. John Dewey, centuries later, argued that learning is inseparable from experience — that the best education doesn't just transmit information but engages students in genuine inquiry and problem-solving.

Different traditions emphasize different aspects of learning. Confucian education stresses the moral dimension: to learn is to cultivate yourself as a person, not just to acquire skills. In many Indigenous traditions, learning is relational — knowledge is passed through stories, practices, and relationships with elders and the land. The Buddhist emphasis on "direct knowing" suggests that some truths can't be learned from books at all; they have to be realized through practice. What all these traditions share is the conviction that learning isn't passive — it's something you do, and it changes who you are.
