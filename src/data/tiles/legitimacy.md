Legitimacy is what makes the difference between authority and mere force — the quality that makes people obey not because they're afraid but because they believe the authority has the *right* to command. A mugger with a gun has power; a government with legitimacy has something more.

Max Weber identified three types of legitimate authority: **traditional** (obey because it's always been this way — kings, elders, customs), **charismatic** (obey because of the exceptional qualities of the leader — prophets, revolutionary figures), and **rational-legal** (obey because the rules were made through proper procedures — modern bureaucratic states). Each type has strengths and vulnerabilities: tradition is stable but rigid; charisma is powerful but dies with the leader; rational-legal authority is impersonal but can become soulless.

Social contract theory locates legitimacy in consent: government is legitimate when the governed have agreed to it. But when did you consent? Locke argued for tacit consent — by living in a society and benefiting from its institutions, you implicitly agree to its rules. Critics have pointed out that tacit consent is barely consent at all: most people can't realistically leave their country, so their "agreement" is more like acquiescence.

The problem of legitimacy becomes urgent during crises. When does a government lose legitimacy? When it systematically violates the rights it was established to protect? When it no longer serves the common good? Revolutionary thinkers from Locke to Jefferson to Fanon have argued that illegitimate authority can and should be overthrown. The question of legitimacy is never fully settled — it's a continuous negotiation between power and the people over whom it's exercised.
