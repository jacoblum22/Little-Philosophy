Life is the condition of being alive — the mysterious quality that separates a growing tree from a falling rock, a breathing person from a corpse.

Defining life turns out to be surprisingly difficult. Biologists list characteristics — growth, reproduction, metabolism, response to stimuli — but no single trait is necessary or sufficient. Fires grow and consume energy. Crystals reproduce their structure. Viruses sit on the boundary between the living and the non-living. And all of these biological definitions miss the dimension that philosophers care about most: what it means to live, as opposed to merely being alive.

The distinction between biological life and a life worth living runs through philosophy. Socrates declared that "the unexamined life is not worth living" — suggesting that mere biological existence isn't enough. Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia (flourishing) describes a life lived well, where all of a person's capacities are developed and exercised. The existentialists argued that life has no inherent meaning — you have to create it yourself, through your choices and commitments.

Different traditions approach life's meaning differently. In much of Eastern philosophy, the goal isn't to make life meaningful but to see through the illusion that life is a separate thing at all. Buddhism teaches that clinging to life (and fearing death) is a source of suffering. Daoism counsels flowing with the natural rhythms of life and death rather than grasping at permanence. These perspectives don't diminish the importance of life — they reframe the question. Instead of "what is the meaning of life?" they ask: "what is it that's living?"
