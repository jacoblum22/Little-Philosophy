Liminality is the state of being in between — no longer what you were, not yet what you will become. The word comes from the Latin *limen* (threshold), and it describes those disorienting but transformative moments when old structures have dissolved and new ones haven't yet formed.

The concept was introduced by Arnold van Gennep in *The Rites of Passage* (1909) and developed extensively by the anthropologist Victor Turner. Van Gennep observed that rituals of transition — initiation, marriage, funeral — follow a three-stage pattern: separation (leaving your old status), liminality (the ambiguous in-between), and incorporation (entering your new status). The liminal phase is the most philosophically interesting: the initiate is "betwixt and between," stripped of their former identity but not yet invested with a new one.

Turner showed that liminality has broader social implications. During liminal periods, normal hierarchies dissolve and a temporary condition of equality and solidarity emerges — what Turner called *communitas*. This is why festivals, pilgrimages, and revolutionary moments feel so intense: the usual rules are suspended, and people relate to each other as pure human beings rather than as occupants of social roles.

Liminality speaks to universal human experience: adolescence, immigration, career changes, grief, spiritual crisis. Any major transition involves a period of not-knowing-who-you-are that is simultaneously terrifying and potentially transformative. The existentialists would recognize liminal experience as a confrontation with the groundlessness of existence — the moment when comfortable identities fall away and you must choose what to become next.
