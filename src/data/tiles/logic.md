Logic is the study of valid reasoning — the rules that determine when a conclusion follows necessarily from its premises, regardless of what those premises happen to be about.

Aristotle invented formal logic with his theory of the syllogism: "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal." The beauty of this is that its validity has nothing to do with Socrates or mortality — it's the form that makes it valid. You could replace "men" with "unicorns" and "mortal" with "purple" and the reasoning would be just as valid (though the premises would be false). Logic separates the question of good reasoning from the question of true premises.

For over two thousand years, Aristotelian logic was considered essentially complete. Then, in the nineteenth century, Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell developed modern mathematical logic, which proved far more powerful — capable of formalizing reasoning about relations, quantities, and infinite sets that Aristotle's syllogisms couldn't handle. Russell and Whitehead's "Principia Mathematica" attempted to derive all of mathematics from pure logic.

Then Gödel dropped a bomb. His incompleteness theorems (1931) proved that any logical system powerful enough to express arithmetic will contain true statements that it cannot prove. Logic, the most rigorous form of reasoning, has inherent limits — not because we're not clever enough but because limits are built into the nature of formal systems.

Non-Western traditions developed their own logical systems. Indian logic (nyaya) independently discovered many principles of valid inference and added a concern with the conditions under which inference produces genuine knowledge. Buddhist logic, particularly the work of Dignaga and Dharmakirti, integrated logical analysis with epistemology and the practical goal of ending suffering. Logic, in these traditions, is not an abstract game but a tool for liberation.
