Loyalty is the disposition to stand by a person, group, or cause even when it's costly, inconvenient, or contrary to your immediate self-interest. It's a form of commitment that persists through difficulty — the friend who stays when things fall apart, the citizen who serves when things get hard.

Philosophically, loyalty is puzzling because it seems to conflict with impartiality. If morality demands treating everyone equally, how can it be virtuous to favor your friends, your family, your country? Josiah Royce made loyalty the central concept of his entire ethical philosophy, defining it as "the willing and practical and thoroughgoing devotion of a person to a cause." For Royce, loyalty gives life meaning by connecting individuals to something larger than themselves.

But loyalty has a dark side. Blind loyalty — "my country right or wrong" — can lead to complicity in terrible things. The Nuremberg defense ("I was just following orders") is essentially a claim of loyalty to authority overriding moral judgment. This suggests that loyalty is not intrinsically good but depends on what you're loyal to. Loyalty to a just cause is admirable; loyalty to a corrupt institution enables corruption.

Confucian ethics treats loyalty (*zhong*) as a fundamental virtue, but tempers it with *ren* (humaneness) and *yi* (righteousness). A truly loyal minister is one who tells the emperor uncomfortable truths, not one who flatters. This insight — that genuine loyalty sometimes requires disagreement — distinguishes deep loyalty from mere obedience. The most loyal friend might be the one who says what you don't want to hear.
