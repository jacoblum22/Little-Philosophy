Mastery is the deep competence that comes from sustained practice — the state where skill has been so thoroughly internalized that it operates with seemingly effortless precision. The master pianist doesn't think about where to put their fingers; the master carpenter doesn't deliberate about how to join wood. Knowledge has become second nature.

Aristotle's concept of *hexis* (stable disposition) captures this: virtue and skill alike are cultivated through repeated practice until they become part of who you are. The martial arts tradition of *shu-ha-ri* — learn, break, transcend — describes the same trajectory: first you follow the rules exactly, then you creatively adapt them, finally you move beyond them entirely, acting from a kind of intuitive understanding that no rule book can capture.

The psychologist Anders Ericsson's research on "deliberate practice" (often simplified as the "10,000 hours rule") emphasized that mastery requires not just repetition but focused, intentional practice at the edge of your current ability. But the philosophical question goes deeper than technique: what is the relationship between the master and their craft? Heidegger wrote about how a tool "withdraws" from attention when used skillfully — the hammer disappears in the hammering. Mastery is partially defined by this transparency of the medium.

Mastery also carries ethical weight. Confucius described the ideal person as someone who has so thoroughly mastered the principles of *ren* (humaneness) and *li* (ritual propriety) that they can "follow the heart's desire without overstepping the bounds." Mastery, in this sense, is not just technical excellence but the integration of skill, wisdom, and character.
