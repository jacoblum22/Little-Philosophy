Materialism is the philosophical view that everything that exists is material — that matter (and energy, and physical forces) is all there is. There are no souls, no disembodied spirits, no Platonic Forms floating in a non-physical realm. If it exists, it's physical.

The ancient atomists — Democritus and Epicurus — were the first systematic materialists. They proposed that everything in the universe, including the mind and the soul, is composed of tiny indivisible particles (*atomos*) moving through void. This was a remarkably prescient intuition. Modern physics has complicated the details (atoms turned out to be divisible, and quantum mechanics is strange), but the basic materialist picture — reality is physical — is the working assumption of most contemporary science.

The hardest challenge for materialism is consciousness. If everything is physical, what explains the subjective experience of seeing red, feeling pain, or tasting coffee? This is the "hard problem of consciousness" identified by David Chalmers. Materialists have offered various responses: eliminativists (like Paul and Patricia Churchland) argue that our folk-psychological concepts of "belief," "desire," and "experience" will eventually be replaced by neuroscience. Functionalists argue that mental states are defined by their functional roles rather than their physical composition. But the problem stubbornly persists.

Marx used "materialism" differently — his "historical materialism" claims not that everything is made of matter but that the economic base of society (its material conditions of production) determines its ideological superstructure (its laws, religion, philosophy, and art). This is materialism as social theory rather than metaphysics: to understand ideas, look at the material interests they serve.
