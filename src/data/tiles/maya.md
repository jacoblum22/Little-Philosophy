Maya is the veil of illusion that makes the changing, multiple world appear real and self-sufficient — when, according to Hindu philosophy, ultimate reality is something far deeper.

The concept appears as early as the Rig Veda, where maya refers to the creative power of the gods — their ability to produce forms, to shape-shift, to conjure appearances. But in the Upanishads and later Advaita Vedanta, maya takes on a more specifically philosophical meaning: it is the cosmic illusion that makes Brahman (the one, infinite, unchanging reality) appear as the manifold world of separate objects, separate selves, birth and death.

Shankara, the great 8th-century systematizer of Advaita Vedanta, gave maya its sharpest formulation. The world you perceive — this computer, your hands, the sky — is not ultimately real. It's not exactly *unreal* either (you're not hallucinating). It occupies a strange middle status: it is *mithya*, appearance, the way a rope in dim light appears to be a snake. The rope is real. The snake is not. But the *appearance* of the snake is undeniable. Maya is like that — a real illusion, or an illusory reality.

This raises an obvious question: if the world is maya, why bother with it? Shankara's answer is that you don't stop engaging with the world — you stop *mistaking it for ultimate reality*. The problem isn't experience; it's *avidya* (ignorance), the failure to see through the appearance to the Brahman underneath. Enlightenment is not escaping the world but seeing it correctly.

Maya resonates with similar ideas in other traditions. Plato's cave allegory presents ordinary experience as shadow-play. Buddhist dependent origination suggests that what we take for solid, independent things are really interdependent processes. Even modern physics reveals that the solid table is mostly empty space and vibrating fields. The intuition that appearances deceive — that reality is not what it seems — may be one of philosophy's most universal themes.
