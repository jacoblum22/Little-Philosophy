Meaning is what we're looking for when we ask "why?" — not just the cause of something, but its significance, its point, its place in a larger story.

Humans are meaning-making creatures. We don't just experience events; we interpret them, connect them, and search for patterns. A sunset isn't just scattered light — it's beautiful, melancholy, hopeful. A death isn't just biological failure — it's a loss, a transition, a mystery. This compulsive search for significance is so deep that some philosophers consider it the defining feature of human existence.

But does meaning exist out there in the world, or do we project it onto a universe that is, at bottom, indifferent? This is the central tension. Religious traditions generally hold that meaning is built into the fabric of reality — life has a purpose because God or the cosmos or the Dao has organized it that way. The existentialists disagreed. Sartre argued that the universe has no inherent meaning; we are "condemned to be free" and must create meaning for ourselves. Camus pushed further: in "The Myth of Sisyphus," he argued that the confrontation between our need for meaning and the universe's silence produces the absurd — and the question becomes whether we can live meaningfully anyway.

Viktor Frankl, who survived the Nazi concentration camps, argued in "Man's Search for Meaning" that meaning is not invented but discovered — it calls to us from the situations we face. The Japanese concept of ikigai similarly locates meaning at the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. In hermeneutics, the tradition of interpretation theory, meaning is something that emerges between a text and its reader, between a tradition and its interpreter — never fully fixed, always being renegotiated.

The question of meaning may be the most personal philosophical question there is. Not "what is meaning in general?" but "what gives my life meaning?" — and whether the answer you find can hold up against suffering, death, and doubt.
