What makes a life meaningful? This is perhaps the most personal and urgent question in all of philosophy. It tends to arise most powerfully in the face of suffering — when things fall apart, we're driven to ask "why?" and the search for meaning begins.

Some philosophers have argued that meaning is something we *discover* — that the universe has a purpose, and our job is to find our place in it. Religious traditions often take this view: meaning is given by God, by karma, by the cosmic order. Others, especially existentialists like Sartre and Camus, argued that the universe is indifferent — there is no built-in meaning, and we must *create* our own. Camus imagined Sisyphus, condemned to push a boulder up a hill forever, and concluded: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy." Meaning, on this view, is an act of defiance against absurdity.

Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived the Holocaust, offered a middle path: meaning isn't arbitrary, but it isn't handed to us either. We find it through love, through creative work, and through the courage with which we face unavoidable suffering. The search for meaning, he argued, is the primary motivation in human life.
