Meditation is the practice of training attention — usually by turning it inward — in order to achieve clarity, calm, insight, or some fundamental transformation of consciousness.

The practice is ancient and cross-cultural, but its most systematic development is in the Buddhist and Hindu traditions. The word dhyana (Sanskrit, from which "Zen" derives via Chinese chan) means absorbed concentration. In Buddhism, meditation comprises two main approaches: samatha (calm-abiding, focused concentration on a single object) and vipassana (insight, clear seeing of the nature of experience). The goal of vipassana is not relaxation but wisdom — seeing directly that experience is impermanent, unsatisfying, and empty of a fixed self. This seeing is not intellectual understanding but experiential realization, which is why reading about it doesn't substitute for doing it.

Hindu meditation traditions overlap significantly but orient differently. In Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, meditation is one step in an eightfold path whose goal is the cessation of mental fluctuations (chitta vritti nirodha). The deepest states of meditation (samadhi) involve the dissolution of the boundary between the meditator and the object of meditation — a direct experience of unity.

Christian contemplative traditions developed their own forms. The anonymous author of "The Cloud of Unknowing" described a practice of letting go of all thoughts and concepts to rest in God's presence. The Eastern Orthodox practice of hesychasm involves repeating the Jesus Prayer until it becomes continuous — the prayer of the heart. In Sufism, dhikr (remembrance of God through repetitive chanting) serves a similar function.

What's philosophically interesting about meditation is its epistemic claim: that there are truths about the mind and reality that can only be discovered through sustained, disciplined introspection. This challenges the Western philosophical tradition, which has generally trusted argument and analysis over direct observation of consciousness. If meditators across cultures and centuries report similar insights — about the nature of self, the texture of awareness, the possibility of liberation — does that constitute a kind of evidence?
