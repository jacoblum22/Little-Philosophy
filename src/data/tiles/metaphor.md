A metaphor is a way of understanding one thing in terms of another — saying "time is money" or "life is a journey" or "argument is war." It seems like a literary decoration, but philosophers and linguists have argued that metaphor is not ornamentation. It's how thinking actually works.

Aristotle was the first to analyze metaphor systematically, treating it as an implicit comparison that reveals hidden similarities. For centuries, philosophers treated metaphor as a shortcut — a colorful way of saying something that could, in principle, be stated literally. But in the twentieth century, this view was overturned. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argued in *Metaphors We Live By* that our entire conceptual system is metaphorical. We don't just talk about arguments as if they were wars; we experience them that way. We don't just describe time as a resource; we structure our lives around that metaphor.

This matters philosophically because it means metaphor isn't just about language — it's about thought. If our fundamental concepts (causation, morality, mind, self) are built on metaphors, then the metaphors we use shape what we can think. Nietzsche made this point dramatically: "What then is truth? A mobile army of metaphors." He suggested that all of our supposedly literal concepts were once metaphors that got forgotten.

Paul Ricoeur argued that metaphor has a special power: it creates new meaning rather than just restating old meaning in a new way. A good metaphor shows you something you couldn't see before. In this sense, metaphor is not the enemy of philosophical precision but one of its most powerful tools.
