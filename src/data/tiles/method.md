Method is the systematic way of doing something — a set of principles or procedures that, if followed, should lead reliably toward truth, understanding, or a desired result.

Descartes inaugurated modern philosophy with a method: start by doubting everything, then rebuild knowledge on the one thing that survives the doubt. His four rules (accept nothing as true unless clearly evident; divide problems into parts; proceed from simple to complex; review everything) were meant to provide a universal method for discovering truth — a thinking algorithm that anyone could follow.

Francis Bacon proposed a rival method: induction. Instead of starting with self-evident truths and reasoning downward, start with careful observations and reason upward to general principles. This empirical method became the foundation of modern science, refined over centuries into the hypothetico-deductive method: form a hypothesis, deduce predictions, test them experimentally, revise the hypothesis.

But the question of whether there is one right method — or whether different questions require different methods — remains open. Husserl argued that philosophy needs its own method (phenomenology): instead of looking outward at the world, look inward at the structures of experience. Gadamer argued that the humanities need hermeneutics: interpretation rather than explanation. The social sciences still debate whether they should follow the methods of natural science or develop their own.

Paul Feyerabend made the most radical challenge: in "Against Method," he argued that the only rule of method that doesn't inhibit scientific progress is "anything goes." Every methodological rule, however reasonable, has been productively violated at some point in the history of discovery. Method, Feyerabend suggested, is not the engine of knowledge but sometimes its cage.
