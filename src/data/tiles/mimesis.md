*Mimesis* (μίμησις) is the Greek concept of imitation or representation — the idea that art holds a mirror to reality. It's the oldest and most influential theory of art in Western philosophy, and the debate about whether it's right or wrong has shaped aesthetics for over two millennia.

Plato was suspicious of mimesis. Art, he argued, is an imitation of an imitation: the physical world already imitates the eternal Forms, and art imitates the physical world — putting it at two removes from truth. A painting of a bed is less real than a physical bed, which is itself less real than the Form of Bed. Worse, art appeals to the emotions rather than reason, making it dangerous for a well-ordered soul or society. Plato wanted to banish most poets from his ideal Republic.

Aristotle rescued mimesis by arguing that it has genuine cognitive value. In the *Poetics*, he showed that tragedy doesn't just copy events but reveals their underlying structure — the causes, patterns, and necessities that make human action intelligible. Art shows not what happened but "what would happen" given certain conditions. It's truer than history in this sense: it captures the universal through the particular.

Later theories of art moved away from mimesis. Romanticism valued expression and originality over imitation. Modernism abandoned representation for abstraction. Postmodernism questioned whether there's any stable "reality" to imitate. But mimesis keeps returning in new forms: realist fiction, documentary film, virtual reality. The human desire to create representations of the world — and to learn from them — seems to be one of our deepest impulses.
