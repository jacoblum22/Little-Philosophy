The mind is whatever it is that thinks, feels, perceives, and is aware — the inner theater of experience that each of us inhabits but can never directly share with another.

The central question of philosophy of mind is the mind-body problem: what is the relationship between mental experience and the physical brain? Descartes established the modern version by declaring mind and body two entirely different substances — the mind thinks but has no spatial location; the body extends through space but doesn't think. But this creates an obvious puzzle: if they're so different, how do they interact? How does the decision to raise your arm (a mental event) cause your arm to rise (a physical event)? Descartes never solved this, and in a sense, we still haven't.

Modern approaches have multiplied. Materialism says the mind just is the brain — mental states are identical to brain states. Functionalism says the mind is defined not by what it's made of but by what it does — a mind is any system that processes information in the right way, whether it's neurons, silicon, or something else entirely. This is why the question of artificial intelligence is really a question about the mind: if a computer does everything a mind does, is it a mind?

But something seems to escape all these theories: the felt quality of experience. There's something it's like to see red, to taste coffee, to feel grief — and it's not obvious how any physical description can capture that. This is what philosopher David Chalmers called the "hard problem" of consciousness. The easy problems are explaining behavior, information processing, and neural correlates. The hard problem is explaining why any of that is accompanied by subjective experience at all.

In Buddhist psychology, mind (citta) is not a fixed thing but a rapidly changing stream of mental moments, each arising and passing away. There is no permanent "mind-stuff" — just a process. Whether this dissolution of mind into process solves the mind-body problem or deepens it remains an open question.
