Mindfulness is the practice of paying full, non-judgmental attention to the present moment — noticing what is happening right now, inside and outside you, without trying to change it.

The concept originates in Buddhist practice, where *sati* (the Pali word usually translated as "mindfulness") is one of the seven factors of enlightenment and the seventh step of the Noble Eightfold Path. In Buddhist psychology, the untrained mind is constantly somewhere else — replaying the past, rehearsing the future, narrating and judging experience rather than simply *having* it. Mindfulness is the antidote: the deliberate return of attention to what is actually happening.

The *Satipatthana Sutta*, one of the most important discourses on mindfulness, identifies four foundations of awareness: body (breathing, posture, sensations), feelings (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral), mind (states of consciousness), and dharmas (the patterns and principles of experience). The practice is not about achieving a special state but about clearly seeing ordinary experience.

Philosophically, mindfulness connects to Husserl's phenomenology — the project of describing experience as it actually presents itself, before theories and assumptions overlay it. Both traditions share the suspicion that we habitually *miss* most of our experience because we're too busy interpreting it. Simone Weil described attention as "the rarest and purest form of generosity" — the willingness to be present to what is, without imposing your own agenda.

In the West, mindfulness has been extracted from its Buddhist context and applied clinically — Jon Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program treats chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. This secularization has been both praised (for making the benefits widely accessible) and criticized (for stripping a contemplative practice of its ethical and philosophical framework, turning it into a stress-management technique for capitalism).

The philosophical question mindfulness raises is deceptively simple: why is paying attention so difficult, and what changes when you actually do it?
