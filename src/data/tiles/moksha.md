Moksha is the Hindu concept of ultimate liberation — the release of the soul from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, and its realization of its true nature.

If samsara is the wheel, moksha is getting off. But what that actually means depends on which Hindu tradition you ask.

In Advaita Vedānta, the school of Śaṅkara, moksha is the recognition that your individual self (*ātman*) has always been identical with Brahman — the infinite, undivided ground of all reality. There is no real separation between you and the divine; separation is *māyā* (illusion), caused by *avidyā* (ignorance). Moksha isn't going somewhere or becoming something new. It's realizing what has always been true: *tat tvam asi* — "you are that." The wave realizes it has always been the ocean.

In Viśiṣṭādvaita (Rāmānuja's "qualified non-dualism"), moksha is not absorption into a featureless absolute but loving union with God (Viṣṇu). The soul doesn't dissolve into Brahman; it joins the divine community while retaining its individuality. This is a moksha of relationship, not obliteration.

Madhva's Dvaita (dualism) insists that even in liberation, the individual soul and God remain permanently distinct. Moksha is eternal communion with the divine, like a flame near a fire but never merging into it.

The common thread is that moksha ends suffering by ending ignorance. What you thought was real — the separateness of things, the independence of the ego, the finality of death — turns out to be a misperception. Liberation is seeing clearly.

The four classical Hindu paths to moksha reflect different temperaments: *jnāna yoga* (the path of knowledge), *bhakti yoga* (devotion), *karma yoga* (selfless action), and *rāja yoga* (meditation and mental discipline). The Bhagavad Gita teaches that all four paths lead to the same destination.

Moksha asks a radical question: what if freedom isn't about getting more of what you want, but about realizing that the "you" who wants things was never quite who you thought it was?
