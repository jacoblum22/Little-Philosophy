Monism is the view that reality is fundamentally *one* — that beneath the apparent diversity of the world, there is a single substance, principle, or type of being.

This is one of the oldest ideas in philosophy. The pre-Socratic philosopher Thales proposed that everything is water. Anaximenes said air. Heraclitus said fire (or more precisely, an eternal process of transformation). These early attempts seem quaint, but the impulse behind them is profound: the belief that the bewildering variety of things must ultimately be explicable in terms of something simple and unified.

Spinoza gave monism its most rigorous modern formulation. In the *Ethics*, he argued that there is exactly one substance, which he called "God, or Nature" (*Deus sive Natura*). Everything that exists is a mode or expression of this single substance. Mind and matter are not two separate things (as Descartes claimed) but two *attributes* of the same underlying reality. You are not a mind trapped in a body; you are one thing, seen from two perspectives.

In Indian philosophy, Advaita Vedanta holds that Brahman — pure, infinite consciousness — is the only reality. The world of separate objects and separate selves is *maya* (illusion). Shankara argued this with extraordinary philosophical rigor: since Brahman is infinite, there cannot be anything outside it; therefore the world of multiplicity cannot be ultimately real.

Monism stands opposed to *dualism* (mind and matter are fundamentally different substances, as Descartes argued) and *pluralism* (reality consists of many irreducibly different things). The appeal of monism is elegance and unity. Its challenge is explaining how one thing can appear as many — how the infinite manifests as the finite, how consciousness and rocks can be "the same stuff."

Modern physics sometimes seems to support monism — everything reduces to quantum fields, and even space and time may be emergent. But whether this scientific unification supports philosophical monism or merely a different kind of reductionism is a question that remains open.
