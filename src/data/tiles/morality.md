Morality is the system of principles we use to distinguish right from wrong — the set of rules, intuitions, and ideals that guide our actions toward or away from certain choices.

Where does morality come from? This is one of the great divides in philosophy. Some say morality comes from God: an action is right because God commands it, and wrong because God forbids it. But Socrates asked a devastating question in the Euthyphro: is something good because the gods love it, or do the gods love it because it's good? If the first, morality is just divine whim. If the second, goodness is independent of the gods — and we need another explanation.

Secular philosophers have offered several. Kant argued that morality comes from pure reason: any rational being, thinking clearly, would arrive at the same moral law. Utilitarians like Bentham and Mill said morality is about outcomes — the right action is whatever produces the most happiness. Virtue ethicists, following Aristotle, focus on character rather than rules: a moral person is someone who has cultivated the right dispositions. Each approach has strengths and blind spots, and no one has successfully unified them.

The deepest challenge in moral philosophy may be moral relativism: the idea that morality is just a matter of cultural convention, with no objective truth. If the Aztecs believed human sacrifice was moral and modern Westerners believe it's murder, who's right — and by what standard? Most philosophers resist full relativism (it seems to make moral progress impossible), but even the strongest moral realists struggle to explain exactly where moral facts come from if not from God, nature, or reason. The question of what makes something genuinely wrong — not just unpopular — remains open.
