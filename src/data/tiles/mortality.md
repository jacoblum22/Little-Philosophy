Mortality is the fact that you are going to die — and the philosophical question of what difference that makes to how you should live.

Every human culture has grappled with mortality, and the responses range from denial to defiance to acceptance. The Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest surviving work of literature, is about a king's desperate, failed quest for immortality. The lesson Gilgamesh finally learns — that death is inevitable, and meaning must be found in mortal life — has been restated in every century since.

Epicurus tried to dissolve the fear of death through logic: "Where death is, I am not; where I am, death is not. Therefore death is nothing to me." If death is the cessation of experience, there's no one there to suffer it. But this argument, however valid, has convinced almost no one, because the fear of death isn't primarily about the experience of being dead — it's about the *loss* of being alive.

Heidegger made mortality the centerpiece of his account of human existence. Dasein (human being) is *Sein-zum-Tode*: being-toward-death. Most of the time we evade this knowledge, losing ourselves in daily busyness, telling ourselves death happens to other people. But in rare moments of authentic confrontation with our own finitude, everything changes. Our mortality gives life urgency, forces choices, makes things matter. Without death, nothing would be at stake.

The Stoics practiced *memento mori* — deliberate reminders of death — not to depress themselves but to sharpen their appreciation of life. Marcus Aurelius wrote: "Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now, take what's left and live it properly." The awareness of mortality, rightly held, doesn't paralyze but liberates.

Buddhism takes a different approach. The reality of death (*maranasati*) is a meditation object precisely because it dissolves attachment. If everything is impermanent, clinging is the source of suffering. Mortality is not a problem to be solved but a truth to be integrated.
