Mysticism is the claim that there is a form of knowledge deeper than reason — a direct experience of ultimate reality that can't be captured in words.

Every major religious and philosophical tradition has a mystical strand. Christian mystics like Meister Eckhart and Teresa of Ávila described union with God so intimate that the boundary between self and divine dissolves. Sufi mystics like Rumi and Ibn Arabi spoke of *fanāʾ* — the annihilation of the ego in the beloved. The Jewish Kabbalistic tradition maps the hidden structure of divine reality. Hindu sages describe *samadhi* — absorption into Brahman. Buddhist practitioners pursue *nirvana* — the extinguishing of craving and the illusion of self. Despite vast differences in theology and practice, all these traditions converge on a strikingly similar claim: the deepest reality is beyond conceptual thought, and accessing it transforms you.

William James identified four marks of mystical experience in *The Varieties of Religious Experience*: ineffability (it can't be put into words), noetic quality (it feels like knowledge, not just emotion), transiency (it doesn't last), and passivity (it happens to you; you can't force it). These criteria have held up remarkably well across a century of study.

Philosophy has always had an uneasy relationship with mysticism. If the ultimate truth is beyond language and logic, then philosophy — which works through language and logic — can't get there. Plotinus, the Neoplatonist, described the highest reality (the One) as beyond being, beyond thought, accessible only through a kind of "flight of the alone to the Alone." Wittgenstein's famous conclusion to the *Tractatus* — "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" — points at the same boundary between the sayable and the unsayable.

The skeptical response is obvious: if mystical experiences are ineffable, how do we know they're experiences of reality and not just unusual brain states? Neuroscience has shown that meditation, fasting, and certain substances can produce mystical experiences reliably, which might suggest they're natural phenomena rather than supernatural encounters. Mystics tend to reply that the experience carries its own conviction — that once you've had it, the question of "proof" misses the point entirely.

Whether mysticism is humanity's deepest insight or its most persistent illusion, it names a dimension of experience that pure reason can describe but never fully enter.
