A myth is a sacred story that a culture tells to explain how things came to be and what they mean — why we suffer, why we die, where the world came from, and how we should live.

In everyday language, "myth" means "something false." In philosophy, anthropology, and religious studies, it means almost the opposite: a myth is a story that carries truth too deep for literal statement. The Genesis creation story, the Mahabharata, the Dreamtime narratives of Aboriginal Australians, the Norse Ragnarök — these aren't failed science. They're doing something science doesn't attempt: providing meaning, orientation, and a framework for understanding human existence.

Plato had a complicated relationship with myth. He criticized the Homeric myths for presenting the gods as petty and immoral. But he also *created* myths — the Allegory of the Cave, the Allegory of the Chariot, the Myth of Er — when philosophical argument alone couldn't carry the weight of what he wanted to say. His myths function as thought experiments wrapped in narrative: ways of making abstract truths vivid and memorable.

Nietzsche saw myth as essential to cultural vitality. In *The Birth of Tragedy*, he argued that Greek culture achieved greatness because it was rooted in living myths — stories of Dionysus and Apollo that gave form to the deepest human experiences of suffering, ecstasy, and creation. When Socratic rationalism killed the myths, something vital was lost. Modern culture, Nietzsche thought, suffers from mythlessness: we have facts but no meaning.

Cassirer, Eliade, and Joseph Campbell each developed theories of myth as a fundamental mode of human consciousness. Campbell's concept of the "monomyth" or "hero's journey" — departure, initiation, return — suggests that myths across cultures share a deep structure because they reflect universal patterns of human experience.

The question myths raise is whether rational, scientific modernity can provide what myths once did: not just information about the world, but a sense that the world *matters*, that life has a shape, that suffering has a place in a larger story.
