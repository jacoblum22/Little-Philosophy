Narrative is the distinctively human way of organizing experience into sequences that have beginnings, middles, and ends — and through that organization, creating meaning.

Humans are storytelling animals. We don't just experience events; we connect them into plots. "The king died, and then the queen died" is a chronicle. "The king died, and then the queen died of grief" is a narrative — because the second event is explained by the first, and together they form a meaningful whole. E. M. Forster drew this distinction, and it captures something essential: narrative is not just a sequence of events but events connected by *because*.

Philosophically, narrative matters because it may be fundamental to how we understand ourselves. Paul Ricoeur argued that personal identity is narrative identity — that who you are is the story you tell about your life, the way you connect your past, present, and anticipated future into a coherent plot. Without narrative, experience would be a buzzing confusion of disconnected moments. With it, suffering becomes sacrifice, accidents become turning points, and random events become fate.

Alasdair MacIntyre made a related argument about ethics. We can only understand an action by seeing it as part of a larger story — a practice, a tradition, a life lived toward particular ends. Stripped of narrative context, the same physical movement could be "gardening," "getting exercise," "pleasing my spouse," or "doing penance." The *meaning* of an action depends on the story in which it appears.

But there's a danger. The stories we tell can distort as much as illuminate. Colonial narratives justified conquest as "civilizing." Nationalist narratives create enemies. Personal narratives can trap us in victim stories or hero stories that don't match reality. Hayden White argued that even historical writing is shaped by narrative conventions — tragedy, comedy, romance — that historians import from literature.

Narrative is both our greatest tool for making meaning and our greatest tool for manufacturing it.
