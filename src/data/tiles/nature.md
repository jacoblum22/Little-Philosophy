Nature is the world as it exists apart from human intervention — the rivers, mountains, animals, stars, and physical laws that would carry on whether we were here or not.

But does nature really exist "apart from" us? This turns out to be a surprisingly contentious question. In the modern Western tradition, nature is typically understood as the physical world — the object of scientific study, governed by laws of physics and chemistry. But many other traditions see no sharp boundary between the human and the natural. In much of Indigenous thought, humans are part of nature, not separate from it. The Lakota phrase "Mitakuye Oyasin" — "all my relations" — includes not just people but animals, plants, and the earth itself. In Daoist philosophy, nature (the Tao) is the fundamental pattern of reality, and the highest wisdom is to align oneself with its flow.

The Western philosophical tradition has had a more complicated relationship with nature. The ancient Greeks saw nature (physis) as the essence of things — what they are by their own internal principles. Aristotle studied nature empirically; the Stoics sought to live "according to nature." But the modern era brought a dramatic shift: Francis Bacon declared that nature should be "conquered" and made to serve human purposes. This instrumental view of nature — as a resource to be exploited — has shaped the modern world, for better and worse.

Today, questions about nature have become urgent. Environmental philosophy asks whether nature has intrinsic value — value in itself, apart from its usefulness to humans. Deep ecologists argue that it does. Others ask whether the very concept of "nature" is still meaningful in an age when human activity has altered every ecosystem on the planet. What does it mean to "return to nature" when there's nowhere human influence hasn't reached?
