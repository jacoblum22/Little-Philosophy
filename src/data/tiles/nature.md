Nature is what emerges when wonder meets the world — the drive to understand the natural order, the patterns and laws that govern everything from the stars to the seasons to the growth of living things.

The earliest philosophers — the Pre-Socratics — were "natural philosophers" first. Thales asked what everything is made of (water, he guessed). Heraclitus saw nature as constant change ("everything flows"). Democritus proposed that everything is made of atoms. This same impulse to understand nature eventually gave rise to science, but philosophy still asks questions that science can't answer: Why does nature follow laws at all? Is nature all there is? And what is our place within it?
