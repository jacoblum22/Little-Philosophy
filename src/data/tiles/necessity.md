Necessity is what *must* be the case — what could not have been otherwise. Two plus two *necessarily* equals four; it's not a matter of luck or circumstance. Necessity is the logical complement of contingency (what happens to be the case but could have been different) and possibility (what could be the case but isn't).

The concept goes back to the earliest philosophy. Parmenides argued that Being is necessary — nonexistence is impossible, because you can't even think about nothingness without making it something. Aristotle distinguished between necessary truths ("all bachelors are unmarried") and contingent truths ("Socrates is sitting"), laying the groundwork for centuries of work in modal logic.

Leibniz made the distinction famous with his contrast between "truths of reason" (necessary, like mathematics) and "truths of fact" (contingent, like the existence of this particular world). He argued that this world exists because God chose it as the best of all possible worlds — so its existence is contingent on God's choice, not logically necessary. Hume challenged the entire framework by arguing that what we call necessity (especially causal necessity) is really just a habit of expectation — we see one billiard ball hit another and *expect* the second to move, but there's no logical necessity linking them.

In modern philosophy, Saul Kripke revived discussions of necessity by arguing that some truths are necessarily true even though they can only be discovered through experience ("necessary a posteriori" truths, like "water is H2O"). The question of what's necessary versus what's contingent reaches into the deepest questions about the structure of reality, the limits of logic, and whether the universe had to be this way or could have been otherwise.
