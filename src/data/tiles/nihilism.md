Nihilism is the conviction that nothing — truly nothing — has any objective value, meaning, or purpose.

It's the philosophical boogeyman. Parents worry their children will become nihilists. Critics accuse art movements, political ideologies, and entire generations of it. But nihilism, taken seriously, is one of the most challenging positions in philosophy — not because it's attractive, but because it's surprisingly hard to refute.

The word comes from the Latin *nihil* — "nothing." Nietzsche is most associated with it, though he wasn't a nihilist himself. He was its diagnostician. "God is dead," he announced, and the death of God wasn't just a statement about religion. It was a warning about values. For centuries, Western civilization had grounded its morality, its meaning, its entire framework of significance in a religious worldview. If that foundation collapses, what happens to everything built on it? The answer, Nietzsche feared, was nihilism — a world where nothing matters, nothing is worth doing, and human life is just sound and fury signifying nothing.

Nietzsche saw this as a crisis to be *overcome*, not embraced. His concept of the Übermensch (overman) and eternal recurrence were attempts to create meaning in a world without ready-made meaning — to say "yes" to life so emphatically that you would will every moment of it to recur infinitely.

But nihilism comes in varieties. *Moral nihilism* says there are no objective moral facts — nothing is really right or wrong. *Existential nihilism* says life has no inherent purpose or meaning. *Epistemic nihilism* questions whether knowledge itself is possible. *Cosmic nihilism* goes furthest: the universe is fundamentally indifferent, and human existence is a temporary accident in an uncaring void.

The existentialists responded to nihilism not by denying it but by building on top of it. Camus argued that the absence of inherent meaning is precisely what makes human meaning-making heroic. Sartre held that we create values through our choices, and that pretending otherwise is bad faith. The question isn't whether life has meaning — it doesn't, objectively — but whether you have the courage to create meaning anyway.

Nihilism's enduring power is its honesty. Its enduring weakness is that even nihilists can't quite live as if nothing matters.
