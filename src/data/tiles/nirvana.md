Nirvana is the Buddhist term for the complete cessation of suffering — the extinguishing of the fires of craving, aversion, and ignorance that keep beings trapped in the cycle of rebirth.

The word means "blowing out" or "extinguishing" — like a candle flame going out. This isn't annihilation. It's the ending of everything that causes suffering: the grasping, the clinging, the desperate attachment to things that are impermanent. What remains when the fires go out isn't nothing — but it's also not a "something" that can be described in ordinary language.

The Buddha was famously reluctant to describe nirvana in positive terms. When pressed, he used negations: it is the unconditioned, the unborn, the deathless, the end of suffering. This wasn't evasion — it reflected the conviction that nirvana is beyond the categories of ordinary thought. Trying to describe it with concepts formed by unenlightened minds is like trying to explain color to someone who has never seen.

Theravāda Buddhism generally presents nirvana as the final goal of individual practice. Through the Noble Eightfold Path — right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration — a person progressively weakens the *kleshas* (mental afflictions) until they are completely eliminated. An *arhat* (enlightened being) attains nirvana and, upon death, is not reborn. This is *parinirvana* — complete and final liberation.

Mahāyāna Buddhism reframed the goal. Nāgārjuna's groundbreaking argument was that samāra (the cycle of suffering) and nirvana are not ultimately different. They are two ways of experiencing the same reality. The bodhisattva doesn't escape the world — they remain in it, out of compassion, helping all sentient beings awaken. Nirvana isn't a distant destination; it's the nature of reality itself, obscured by ignorance and revealed by wisdom.

The question nirvana poses to Western philosophy is radical: is it possible to end suffering not by changing your circumstances but by transforming the way you relate to experience itself? And if so, what exactly is left when suffering stops?
