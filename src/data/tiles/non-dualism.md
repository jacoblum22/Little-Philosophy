Non-dualism (*advaita* in Sanskrit) is the philosophical view that reality is ultimately one — that the apparent distinction between self and world, subject and object, individual and divine, is an illusion masking a deeper unity.

The most influential formulation comes from Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, an eighth-century school of Hindu philosophy. Shankara argued that *atman* (the individual self) and *Brahman* (ultimate reality) are identical. The perceived separation between you and the universe is *maya* — not exactly "illusion" in the sense of being fake, but more like a misperception, the way a rope in dim light might be mistaken for a snake. Enlightenment, on this view, is simply recognizing what was always true: you are not a separate self looking out at a separate world. You are the whole.

Non-dualism appears in other traditions under different names. In Buddhism, the Madhyamaka school teaches the emptiness (*śūnyatā*) of all things — including the distinction between nirvana and samsara. In Daoism, the Dao that can be spoken of is not the true Dao; the boundaries language creates (good/bad, self/other, being/non-being) are conventional rather than ultimate. Even in Western philosophy, thinkers like Spinoza and Hegel have been read as non-dualists: Spinoza's "God or Nature" dissolves the creator-creation distinction, and Hegel's Absolute reconciles all oppositions within itself.

Non-dualism is not just a metaphysical thesis but a lived orientation. If the separation between self and world is illusory, then selfishness — clinging to your own interests at the expense of others — is based on a mistake. Compassion becomes not a moral effort but the natural response when you see clearly that the other is not truly other.
