Nonviolence is the principled refusal to use physical force to achieve political, social, or personal ends. Far from being passive submission, it's an active strategy of resistance that seeks to defeat injustice without creating new cycles of violence.

The philosophical roots run deep. The Jain principle of *ahimsa* (non-harm) extends nonviolence not just to humans but to all living beings. The Buddha taught that hatred never ceases by hatred, only by love. Jesus instructed his followers to "turn the other cheek" and love their enemies. These traditions understood nonviolence not as weakness but as a form of spiritual strength.

Gandhi synthesized these traditions into a political philosophy he called *satyagraha* — "truth-force" or "soul-force." He argued that nonviolent resistance works by appealing to the conscience of the oppressor and the wider public, exposing the moral bankruptcy of violent systems. His campaigns against British colonial rule proved that nonviolence could be effective at the national scale — though the question of whether it "worked" because of its moral power or because of the political costs it imposed on Britain remains debated.

Martin Luther King Jr. adapted Gandhi's methods for the American civil rights movement, grounding nonviolence in Christian theology and democratic principles. King argued that nonviolence doesn't just avoid physical harm — it creates what he called the "Beloved Community," because it refuses to dehumanize even those who dehumanize you. Critics from Frantz Fanon to Malcolm X argued that nonviolence is a strategy the powerful recommend to the powerless. The debate between nonviolent and violent approaches to liberation remains one of the most urgent in political philosophy.
