Observation is what happens when you look at the world carefully and deliberately — not just experiencing it passively, but actively examining it. It's experience with attention and intention.

Observation is the foundation of empirical knowledge — the idea that we learn about the world by watching it closely. But philosophers have raised deep questions about whether observation can ever be truly neutral. Do we see the world as it really is, or do our expectations, language, and assumptions color what we observe? The philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that even scientists don't observe the same things when they look at the same data — their theories shape what they see.
