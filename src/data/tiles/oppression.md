Oppression is the systematic and unjust use of power to restrict, diminish, or control another person or group. It's not just individual cruelty — it's cruelty embedded in structures, institutions, and ways of life that can persist even when no one consciously intends it.

Iris Marion Young identified five "faces" of oppression: exploitation (using others' labor for your benefit), marginalization (pushing groups to the edges of society), powerlessness (lacking authority or voice), cultural imperialism (having your culture erased or made invisible), and violence (systematic physical or psychological threat). This framework reveals that oppression takes many forms beyond the obvious ones, and that someone can be oppressed along one dimension while being privileged along another.

Paulo Freire's *Pedagogy of the Oppressed* offered one of the most psychologically penetrating analyses: oppression doesn't just harm the body but colonizes the mind. The oppressed internalize the values of their oppressors, coming to see themselves as inferior and their condition as natural or deserved. Liberation therefore requires not just political change but "conscientization" — becoming aware of the structures that hold you down and developing the capacity to imagine alternatives.

Frantz Fanon explored similar territory in the context of colonialism, showing how racial oppression deforms the consciousness of both colonizer and colonized. Simone de Beauvoir analyzed the oppression of women by showing how they are constructed as "the Other" — the deviation from a male norm. What all these thinkers share is the insight that oppression is not just about who has power, but about how power shapes what people believe, desire, and think is possible.
