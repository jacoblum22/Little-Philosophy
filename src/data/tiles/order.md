Order is the arrangement of things according to pattern, rule, or hierarchy — the opposite of chaos. In political philosophy, it's the basic condition that makes any other social good possible. In metaphysics, it's the question of whether the universe itself has an inherent structure or whether we impose structure on it.

Politically, order is the first promise of government. Hobbes argued that without a sovereign to enforce rules, human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" — a war of all against all. Order, even imperfect order, is better than chaos. Conservatives in the Burkean tradition have emphasized that social order is fragile, built up over centuries through custom and tradition, and easily destroyed by revolutionary enthusiasm. Reform slowly, they argue; don't tear down what you don't fully understand.

But order can be oppressive. "Order" was the word on the lips of every authoritarian who suppressed dissent in the name of stability. Martin Luther King Jr. pointed out that "the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens' Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice." The tension between order and justice — between stability and righteous disruption — is one of the permanent tensions of political life.

In Chinese philosophy, the concept of order is central. The Confucian vision of society is deeply ordered: proper relationships (*wu lun*), proper rituals (*li*), proper roles all creating harmony. The Daoist counterpoint is that the greatest order is not imposed but emergent — the Dao produces order naturally, and human attempts to force order actually create disorder. Nature has its own logic; wisdom is learning to follow it.
