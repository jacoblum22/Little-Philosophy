The Other is the recognition that there are minds beyond your own — beings who see the world from a perspective you can never fully access.

This might seem obvious. Of course other people exist. But philosophically, the Other raises some of the deepest questions we can ask. How do you know that other people have inner experiences at all? You can't see inside someone else's mind. You infer that they think and feel because they behave like you do — but you can never prove it. This is the problem of other minds, and it's been troubling philosophers since at least Descartes.

But the Other isn't just an intellectual puzzle — it's a moral and existential challenge. Emmanuel Levinas argued that the face of the Other makes an ethical demand on us before we even think about it. To encounter another person is to be called into responsibility. Sartre saw the Other as a threat to our freedom: under another's gaze, we become objects, defined in ways we didn't choose. For Simone de Beauvoir, the construction of the "Other" — marking certain groups as fundamentally different — is the root of oppression.

Every philosophical tradition grapples with this tension between self and other. Confucianism builds its entire ethics on the relationships between people. Ubuntu philosophy in southern Africa holds that "I am because we are." The challenge of the Other is learning how to live alongside beings whose inner worlds will always remain partly mysterious to us.
