The Other is the recognition that you are not alone — that there are beings beyond yourself who think, feel, and experience the world in their own way. This might seem obvious, but it's actually a profound philosophical puzzle: how do you know that other minds exist at all?

The concept of the Other opens up entirely new branches of philosophy. Once you acknowledge that others exist, you can ask: What do I owe them? How should we live together? Can I ever truly understand their experience? From ethics to politics to the philosophy of language, the Other is the starting point.
