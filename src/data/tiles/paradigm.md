A paradigm is the framework of assumptions, methods, and standards that defines how a community understands and investigates the world. The concept was made famous by Thomas Kuhn's *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* (1962), one of the most influential books in twentieth-century philosophy of science.

Kuhn argued that science doesn't progress through steady accumulation of facts. Instead, it alternates between long periods of "normal science" — puzzle-solving within an accepted paradigm — and brief, dramatic revolutions when the old paradigm is replaced by a new one. Ptolemaic astronomy gave way to Copernican astronomy; Newtonian physics gave way to Einstein's relativity; the phlogiston theory of combustion gave way to Lavoisier's oxygen theory.

The revolutionary implications of Kuhn's argument lie in his claim that paradigms are "incommensurable" — that scientists working in different paradigms literally see the world differently, ask different questions, and can't fully communicate across the divide. If this is right, science isn't marching toward an objective truth; it's shifting between different ways of organizing experience, each with its own standards of what counts as evidence and explanation.

The concept has been exported far beyond science. People now speak of "paradigm shifts" in business, education, culture, and politics. This broader usage is looser than Kuhn intended, but it captures a real insight: understanding is always structured by frameworks we often don't see because we're inside them. The most radical discoveries aren't new facts but new ways of seeing — new paradigms that transform what "facts" look like.
