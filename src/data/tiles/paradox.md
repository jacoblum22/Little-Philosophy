A paradox is a statement or situation that seems to contradict itself, yet might be pointing at something true that ordinary logic can't quite hold.

The simplest example is the Liar's Paradox: "This statement is false." If it's true, then it's false. If it's false, then it's true. It flips endlessly, like a logical Escher staircase, and no amount of clever reasoning resolves it cleanly. It's not a mistake or a trick — it reveals a genuine limit in our logical systems.

Zeno of Elea weaponized paradoxes against common sense. His most famous: Achilles races a tortoise. The tortoise gets a head start. To overtake it, Achilles must first reach where the tortoise was, but by then the tortoise has moved. He must reach *that* point, but the tortoise has moved again. The logic seems to prove that motion is impossible — and yet Achilles obviously outruns the tortoise. What gives? Mathematicians eventually "solved" Zeno with the concept of convergent infinite series, but philosophers argue about whether the underlying puzzle was really a mathematical one or something deeper about the nature of space, time, and infinity.

Paradoxes aren't just logical curiosities. They often signal that our concepts need revision. The Ship of Theseus (if every plank is replaced, is it the same ship?) challenges our notion of identity. The problem of omnipotence (can God create a stone so heavy even God can't lift it?) probes the coherence of theological concepts. Newcomb's paradox (involving a predictor who knows your choices before you make them) destabilizes our theories of rational decision-making.

In the Zen Buddhist tradition, paradox is a *tool*. The *koan* — "What is the sound of one hand clapping?" — isn't a question with an answer. It's a device for breaking the mind's habitual patterns of logical thought, forcing a direct confrontation with reality that bypasses conceptual categories.

Derrida found paradox at the heart of every philosophical concept: every attempt to define a term precisely reveals tensions and contradictions within it. Meaning is never fully stable, never fully present. This isn't a flaw in language — it's a feature of reality.

Paradoxes are where the mind's grip on things slips — and sometimes, what you see in that moment of slippage is more interesting than what you see when you're holding on tight.
