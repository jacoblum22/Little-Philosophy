Peace seems like the simplest of goods — who could be against it? But philosophers have long recognized that peace is more complicated than the mere absence of conflict.

The distinction between "negative peace" (no fighting) and "positive peace" (justice, flourishing, and right relationships) runs through the entire tradition. A slave society can be quiet; a totalitarian state can be orderly. But are they peaceful? Martin Luther King Jr. argued in his *Letter from Birmingham Jail* that the "negative peace which is the absence of tension" is less valuable than the "positive peace which is the presence of justice." True peace requires dealing with the conditions that cause conflict, not just suppressing its symptoms.

Kant wrote one of the most ambitious philosophical treatises on peace, *Perpetual Peace* (1795), arguing that lasting peace requires republican constitutions, international law, and a federation of free states. He believed peace wasn't just a nice ideal but a moral duty — and that history was slowly, painfully moving us toward it. His vision influenced the founding of the League of Nations and later the United Nations.

In Eastern traditions, peace is often conceived as an inner state rather than a political one. The Buddhist concept of *nibbana* (nirvana) is sometimes described as the "peace" that comes from the cessation of craving and suffering. The Daoist concept of harmony with the Dao emphasizes peace as alignment with the natural order. These traditions remind us that external peace without internal peace is fragile, and that the sources of conflict often lie within the human heart as much as in social structures.
