Performance is the enactment of something before an audience — whether on a stage, in a ritual, or in the everyday theater of social life. Philosophically, performance raises questions about identity, authenticity, and the line between being and pretending.

In aesthetics, performance arts (theater, dance, music) have a unique philosophical status. Unlike a painting or a novel, a performance exists only in the moment of its execution. No two performances of Hamlet are identical. This makes performance temporally irreducible — it can't be fully captured in a recording or a script. The liveness of performance, its vulnerability to accident and improvisation, is essential to what it is.

But the most philosophically provocative use of "performance" comes from social theory. Erving Goffman argued in *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life* that all social interaction is performance: we manage impressions, play roles, and maintain a "front stage" and "backstage." Judith Butler pushed this further: gender itself is performative — not a fixed identity you express but something you constitute through repeated acts. You don't perform femininity because you're a woman; the repeated performance of femininity is what produces the category "woman."

J.L. Austin's theory of "performative utterances" showed that some speech acts don't describe reality but create it: saying "I promise" creates a promise; saying "I do" at a wedding creates a marriage. Language can be a kind of performance that brings new social realities into being. Across all these domains, performance blurs the line between doing and being — suggesting that what we are is inseparable from what we do.
