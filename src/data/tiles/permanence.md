Permanence is the quality of enduring without change — the idea that beneath the flux of experience, something stays the same.

The ancient Greeks were obsessed with this question. Parmenides made the radical argument that change is logically impossible: what is, is; what is not, is not; and nothing can go from being to non-being or vice versa. Therefore reality is one, unchanging, and eternal. Heraclitus took the opposite view: everything flows (panta rhei), and the only constant is change itself. The tension between these two positions — permanence vs. flux — is one of the oldest and deepest in philosophy.

Plato tried to reconcile them. The physical world changes constantly, yes — but behind it lies a realm of permanent, perfect Forms. The Form of Justice never changes, even though just actions in the world come and go. The Form of Beauty is eternal, even though beautiful things fade. What is truly real, for Plato, is what is permanent; the changing world is a kind of shadow.

Indian philosophy arrived at a strikingly similar insight. The Upanishads distinguish between the permanent (Brahman, the unchanging ground of all being) and the impermanent (the world of appearances, maya). Buddhism, however, takes Heraclitus' side: anicca (impermanence) is one of the three marks of existence. Nothing whatsoever is permanent — not the self, not the soul, not even the gods. Clinging to permanence is the root of suffering.

The question matters practically, not just theoretically. If nothing is permanent, then loss is built into the nature of things — and grief is not a failure to cope but a correct perception of reality. If something is permanent, then beneath every loss there is a ground that cannot be lost. Which vision you accept shapes not just your metaphysics but your emotional life.
