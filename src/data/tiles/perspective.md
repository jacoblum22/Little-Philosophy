Perspective is the particular angle from which you see the world — shaped by your position in space, time, culture, class, gender, and personal history. The philosophical question is whether perspective is something to be overcome in the pursuit of truth, or whether truth is always perspectival.

Nietzsche championed "perspectivism": the view that all knowledge is interpretation from a particular standpoint. There is no "view from nowhere," no God's-eye perspective that reveals reality as it truly is. Every claim to truth is made by someone, from somewhere, with particular interests and assumptions. This doesn't mean all perspectives are equally valid, but it does mean we should be suspicious of anyone who claims to speak from a position of pure objectivity.

Phenomenologists like Husserl and Merleau-Ponty explored how perspective is literally embodied. You see the world from inside a particular body, with particular sensory equipment, in a particular location. The coffee cup on your desk has a front and a back, a visible surface and a hidden one — you never see the whole thing at once. All perception is perspectival, and yet we manage to build up a coherent understanding of objects that transcends any single view. How? That's the puzzle.

In ethics and politics, perspective has taken on urgency through standpoint theory. Feminist epistemologists argue that marginalized groups can have epistemic advantages — that being on the receiving end of oppression gives you insights into how power works that the powerful themselves can't easily see. This doesn't make any perspective infallible, but it suggests that expanding whose perspectives are heard is not just politically desirable but epistemically valuable.
