Phenomenology is the philosophy that says: before theorizing about the world, look carefully at how it actually appears to you. Start with experience itself.

Edmund Husserl founded phenomenology in the early 20th century as a response to what he saw as a crisis in European thought. The sciences were advancing rapidly, but they'd lost touch with the world as people actually experience it. Physics describes matter in motion; psychology describes brain states; sociology describes social forces. But none of them describe what it's *like* to stand in a field at sunset, to feel shame, to remember a childhood home. Phenomenology returns to that lived experience and takes it seriously as a source of philosophical knowledge.

Husserl's key method is the *epochē* or "phenomenological reduction" — bracketing your assumptions about what's really "out there" and focusing instead on how things appear in consciousness. You don't ask whether the tree exists independently of your perception; you examine the experience of perceiving a tree. How does it appear? How does its meaning unfold? What structures of consciousness make perception possible? This isn't solipsism — it's disciplined attention to the structures of experience.

Heidegger, Husserl's most famous student, transformed phenomenology into an investigation of Being. *Dasein* (human existence) doesn't encounter the world as a set of neutral objects but as a meaningful environment of tools, projects, and concerns. The hammer isn't first perceived as an object with properties; it shows up as *something to hammer with*, within a context of building, repairing, making. This "ready-to-hand" mode of engagement is more primordial than detached observation.

Merleau-Ponty brought the body to the center of phenomenology. We don't experience the world as disembodied minds; we experience it through our bodies — our postures, gestures, habits, and perceptual capacities. The body is not an object we have; it's the medium through which we have a world at all.

Sartre used phenomenology to analyze freedom, bad faith, and the experience of the Other's gaze. Levinas used it to ground ethics in the face-to-face encounter. Beauvoir applied it to the situation of women. In each case, the method is the same: look at experience before explaining it away.
