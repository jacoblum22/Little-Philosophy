Philosophy is literally the "love of wisdom" — from the Greek *philo* (love) and *sophia* (wisdom). But what does it mean to love wisdom? Not to possess it, but to pursue it. The philosopher isn't the person who has all the answers; the philosopher is the person who can't stop asking the questions.

Socrates, often called the father of Western philosophy, didn't write anything down. He just walked around Athens asking people what they meant by justice, courage, beauty, and goodness — and showing them they didn't really know. For Socrates, philosophy wasn't a subject you studied; it was a way of life. "The unexamined life is not worth living," he told the jury that sentenced him to death. He wasn't being dramatic. He meant it: a life without reflection is a life lived on autopilot.

But philosophy isn't only a Western invention. In India, the Upanishads were asking "What is the self?" and "What is ultimate reality?" centuries before Socrates. In China, Confucius was developing a philosophical system centered on ethical relationships and social harmony, while the Daoists were exploring the paradoxes of language, nature, and wu wei (non-action). In Africa, philosophical traditions of communal wisdom, oral argument, and ethical reflection have histories just as deep, even if they've been less visible in university syllabi.

What unites all these traditions? A refusal to accept things at face value. Philosophy starts when you ask "why?" — and then ask "why?" again when the first answer doesn't hold up. It's the discipline of thinking carefully about the things everyone else takes for granted: what's real, what's good, what's true, and what it all means. It doesn't promise you comfort. But it promises you won't be asleep.
