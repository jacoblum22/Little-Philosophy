Piety is reverence toward the divine — the attitude of devotion, respect, and obedience that a person shows toward whatever they hold sacred. But Socrates posed a question about piety in Plato's *Euthyphro* that has haunted philosophy of religion ever since: is something pious because God loves it, or does God love it because it's pious?

This dilemma — known as the Euthyphro dilemma — is devastating. If the pious is pious *because* God loves it, then morality is arbitrary: God could command anything (murder, lying, cruelty) and it would become good simply because God says so. If God loves the pious *because* it's pious, then there's a standard of goodness independent of God, and God's commands are just reports about what's already good. Either God's will is arbitrary, or God's will is superfluous. Most of the history of philosophical theology is an attempt to find a way between these horns.

In practice, piety has meant different things in different traditions. Roman *pietas* was duty toward family, country, and the gods — Aeneas was "pious" because he carried his elderly father on his back as he fled Troy. Confucian *xiao* (filial piety) — reverence toward parents and ancestors — is the foundation of all other virtues. In Islam, *taqwa* (God-consciousness or piety) is the inner state that makes all outward religious practice meaningful.

The Enlightenment challenged piety by asking whether reverence for tradition, authority, or the divine might actually be an obstacle to moral progress. Kant argued that true morality must come from rational duty, not from obedience to any external authority — even God's. Yet many continue to find in piety something reason alone can't provide: a posture of humility before something greater than the self.
