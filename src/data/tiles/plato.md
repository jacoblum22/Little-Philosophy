Plato was Socrates' most brilliant student, and he took his teacher's method in a bold new direction. Where Socrates questioned, Plato built — constructing one of the most ambitious philosophical systems in history.

Plato's central idea is the Theory of Forms: that the physical world we see is just a shadow of a higher reality of perfect, eternal truths. The chair you're sitting in is an imperfect copy of the Form of Chair; the just actions you witness are imperfect reflections of the Form of Justice. True knowledge, for Plato, means seeing past the shadows to grasp these eternal Forms.

Plato founded the Academy in Athens — one of the first institutions of higher learning in the Western world — and wrote dozens of dialogues, with Socrates as the main character, exploring questions about justice, beauty, knowledge, love, and the soul. His influence on Western philosophy is so vast that the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once said, "The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato."
