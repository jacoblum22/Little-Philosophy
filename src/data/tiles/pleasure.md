Pleasure is the felt experience of enjoyment — the positive sensation that draws us toward food, warmth, beauty, love, and a thousand other things.

Epicurus made pleasure the foundation of his philosophy: the good life is the pleasant life, and the point of all action is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. This sounds hedonistic in the modern, indulgent sense — but Epicurus was subtler. He distinguished between "kinetic" pleasures (active enjoyment) and "katastematic" pleasures (the calm absence of pain). The highest pleasure, he argued, isn't feasting and drinking but tranquility — the peaceful state of a mind free from anxiety and a body free from distress. 

Utilitarianism revived this idea centuries later. Jeremy Bentham proposed measuring pleasures quantitatively — their intensity, duration, certainty, and extent — and argued that the best action is the one that produces the greatest total pleasure. John Stuart Mill refined this: some pleasures are qualitatively higher than others. The pleasure of reading Shakespeare is different in kind from the pleasure of eating a donut, and anyone who has experienced both will prefer the first. "Better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."

Other traditions are more suspicious. The Stoics argued that pursuing pleasure makes you a slave to circumstances — what happens when the pleasure stops? Buddhism identifies craving (tanha) as the root of suffering: desire for pleasure keeps the wheel of dissatisfaction spinning. And Kant insisted that morality has nothing to do with pleasure — the right action might be deeply unpleasant. The question of pleasure forces a confrontation: is feeling good the point of life, or is there something more important?
