Poetry is language at its most concentrated and deliberate — words arranged not just to communicate information but to create an experience that can't be reduced to paraphrase.

What makes poetry different from prose? Not rhyme (much great poetry doesn't rhyme). Not meter (free verse abandoned it). The difference is that in a poem, how something is said is inseparable from what is said. You can paraphrase an argument without losing its content. You can't paraphrase a poem without losing the poem. "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" paraphrased becomes "You're nice" — and everything that matters disappears.

Plato famously expelled poets from his ideal Republic. Poetry, he argued, trades in imitation and emotion rather than truth and reason. A painting of a bed is two steps removed from reality (the Form of the bed → the carpenter's bed → the painting). Poetry is similarly distant from truth, and worse, it stirs up dangerous emotions that reason should control.

Aristotle pushed back. In the *Poetics*, he argued that poetry is actually *more philosophical* than history. History tells what happened; poetry tells what *could* happen — it reveals general truths about human nature through particular stories. "Poetry is something more philosophical and of graver import than history."

Heidegger went further, placing poetry at the center of his later philosophy. Language, he argued, is not a tool humans use but the "house of Being" — the medium through which reality discloses itself. Poets are the ones who keep language alive, who prevent it from collapsing into mere information exchange. "Poetically, man dwells upon this earth."

In many traditions, poetry is the original form of sacred speech. The Vedas are hymns. The Psalms are poems. The Quran is considered untranslatable partly because its Arabic is not prose but something closer to poetry — rhythmic, musical, dense with layered meaning. Poetry may be the oldest human art, older than writing, older perhaps than permanent settlement.

What makes poetry endure is precisely what makes it untranslatable: the way sound, rhythm, image, and meaning fuse into something that hits you before you can analyze it.
