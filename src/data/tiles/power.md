Power is the ability to make things happen — to act, to compel, to shape events and people according to your will, whether through force, authority, persuasion, or the quiet structuring of what counts as normal.

The classical view treated power as a possession: you have it or you don't. Hobbes described life without political power as "nasty, brutish, and short" and argued that people surrender their natural power to a sovereign in exchange for order. Machiavelli, less interested in justification, studied how power actually works: through a combination of force and cunning, fear and love, spectacle and calculation.

Marx located power in economic structures: those who own the means of production hold real power, regardless of formal political arrangements. This is why a factory owner in a democracy may have more effective power over workers' lives than a medieval lord did over his serfs — the power just operates differently.

Foucault revolutionized the concept. Power, he argued, is not primarily a thing that rulers possess and subjects lack. It's a network of relationships that permeates every level of society — in schools, hospitals, prisons, families, even in how we understand ourselves. Power produces knowledge and shapes identity: it determines not just what you can do but who you think you are. This makes resistance complicated, because you can't simply "overthrow" power when it's woven into the fabric of everyday life.

Nietzsche saw power as the fundamental drive of all life — the "will to power" — not just dominance over others but the creative impulse to grow, to overcome, to impose form on chaos. For Nietzsche, even the saint and the ascetic are expressing will to power, just directed inward. The question is not whether to exercise power but whether to do it honestly or in disguise.
