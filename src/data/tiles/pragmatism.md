Pragmatism is the distinctively American philosophy that says: don't ask what something *means* in the abstract — ask what difference it *makes* in practice.

Founded by Charles Sanders Peirce in the 1870s and developed by William James and John Dewey, pragmatism rejected the traditional philosophical project of discovering absolute, eternal truths. Instead, it proposed that the meaning of an idea lies in its practical consequences. If two theories produce identical practical effects, then the difference between them is purely verbal — a distinction without a difference.

Peirce started with the "pragmatic maxim": to clarify the meaning of a concept, consider what practical effects the objects of that concept might have. What sensations would you expect? What reactions would you prepare for? The concept's meaning is the sum of those practical implications. This was originally a theory of meaning, not truth.

William James took it further and more controversially. Truth, James argued, is what *works*. An idea is true insofar as it proves useful in navigating experience. This doesn't mean you can believe whatever you like — reality pushes back against false beliefs. But it does mean that truth isn't a static correspondence between mind and world; it's a dynamic property of ideas that help us cope with experience. This scandalized traditional philosophers, who accused James of making truth subjective.

John Dewey applied pragmatism to education, democracy, and social reform. He rejected the "spectator theory of knowledge" — the idea that the mind passively observes reality. Instead, knowing is an active process of inquiry, always driven by specific problems and always tested by results. Education should cultivate this active, experimental intelligence rather than stuffing students with facts.

Pragmatism's greatest contribution may be its temperament rather than any specific doctrine: the insistence that philosophy should address real human problems rather than chase abstractions, and that the test of an idea is not its elegance but its consequences.
