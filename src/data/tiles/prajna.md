*Prajna* (般若) is the Sanskrit and Pali term for the highest form of wisdom in Buddhism — not ordinary knowledge or cleverness, but direct insight into the nature of reality. Specifically, prajna is the wisdom that perceives *śūnyatā* (emptiness): the understanding that all things are interdependent, impermanent, and without fixed self-nature.

In Theravada Buddhism, prajna (Pali: *paññā*) is one of the three trainings alongside morality (*sīla*) and concentration (*samādhi*). It's the insight component of the path — the direct seeing of the Three Marks of Existence (impermanence, suffering, and non-self) that leads to liberation. Without prajna, meditation and morality remain practices without understanding; with it, they become transformative.

In Mahayana Buddhism, prajna takes on a more radical character. The *Prajnaparamita* ("Perfection of Wisdom") sutras, including the famous *Heart Sutra*, push wisdom to its paradoxical limit: "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form." Prajna here is not the intellectual understanding that things are empty but the direct experience of emptiness that dissolves all conceptual categories — including the concept of emptiness itself. Nagarjuna argued that even the teachings of Buddhism are empty; to cling to them as absolute truths is to miss the point entirely.

The crucial pairing in Mahayana is prajna and *karuna* (compassion). Wisdom without compassion is cold and detached; compassion without wisdom is sentimental and potentially harmful. Together, they constitute the two wings of enlightenment. The bodhisattva — the ideal figure of Mahayana Buddhism — embodies both: seeing clearly that all beings are empty of fixed self, and responding to their suffering with boundless care precisely because of that seeing.
