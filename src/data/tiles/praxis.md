Praxis is action informed by theory — doing something not blindly but with understanding, and letting the doing reshape the understanding. It's the bridge between knowing and doing, and one of the most important concepts in the history of philosophy.

Aristotle distinguished praxis from both *theoria* (contemplation for its own sake) and *poiesis* (making or producing). Praxis was action directed at living well — the kind of thoughtful engagement with the world that builds character and sustains communities. It's not just doing; it's doing *wisely*, in a way that is its own reward.

Marx gave praxis a revolutionary edge. He argued that philosophy had spent too long interpreting the world and not enough time changing it. For Marx, true understanding of society comes not from armchair theorizing but from the attempt to transform social conditions. Theory without practice is empty; practice without theory is blind. The two must be united in *praxis* — reflective, purposeful action aimed at liberation.

Paulo Freire developed this idea in *Pedagogy of the Oppressed*, arguing that education itself should be a form of praxis: not depositing information into passive students, but engaging them in critical reflection on their world and action to change it. Freire's "praxis" is a cycle — action, reflection, action — that leads to what he called "conscientization": becoming aware of the structures that oppress you and acting to dismantle them. Praxis, across all these thinkers, is the insistence that thinking and doing are not separate activities but two sides of the same coin.
