Prayer is the practice of addressing the divine — or, more broadly, of orienting the self toward something beyond or greater than the self. It's one of the most universal human practices, found in virtually every culture and religious tradition, and it raises fascinating philosophical questions about the nature of communication, intention, and transcendence.

The philosophical problem of prayer is immediate: if God is omniscient, God already knows what you need. If God is omnibenevolent, God already wants to give it. If God is omnipotent, no human request can change God's mind. So what's prayer for? Aquinas addressed this directly: prayer doesn't change God's mind but changes the one who prays, disposing them to receive what God already intends to give. Prayer, on this view, is not petition but preparation.

Different traditions emphasize different modes of prayer. The Muslim *salat* (five daily prayers) structures the entire day around remembrance of God. Jewish *davening* combines fixed liturgy with personal *kavanah* (intention). Christian contemplative traditions (centering prayer, the Jesus Prayer) aim at a wordless encounter beyond language. Buddhist and Hindu practices of chanting mantras operate on the border of what Western traditions would call "prayer" — they're addressed not to a personal God but to the structure of reality itself.

Simone Weil, the French mystic and philosopher, described prayer as "absolutely unmixed attention." On her view, prayer is less about asking for things than about cultivating a quality of awareness — a total receptivity to what is. This connects prayer to meditation, to aesthetic contemplation, and to philosophical wonder. Whether or not there is a God listening, the practice of intentionally turning attention beyond the self is, for many thinkers, valuable in itself.
