The problem of evil is the oldest and most powerful objection to belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-good God: if such a God exists, why does terrible suffering happen?

The argument is devastatingly simple. If God is omnipotent, he *can* prevent evil. If God is omniscient, he *knows* about evil. If God is omnibenevolent, he *wants* to prevent evil. But evil exists. So either God lacks one of these properties, or God doesn't exist. Epicurus stated this logic around 300 BCE, and twenty-three centuries of theology and philosophy haven't produced an answer that satisfies everyone.

Theological responses — called theodicies — come in several forms. The free will defense (Augustine, Plantinga) argues that God gave humans genuine freedom, and freedom makes evil possible. A world with freedom and the possibility of evil is better than a world of puppets who can only do good. But this doesn't explain natural evil — earthquakes, cancer, birth defects — which have nothing to do with human choices.

The soul-making theodicy (Irenaeus, Hick) argues that suffering is necessary for moral and spiritual growth. Without challenges, courage, compassion, and resilience couldn't exist. But critics ask whether the sheer *amount* and *distribution* of suffering — children dying of bone cancer, entire populations destroyed by natural disasters — can really be justified as character-building exercises.

The Book of Job offers a different response: God's ways are beyond human understanding. When Job demands an explanation for his suffering, God answers with overwhelmingly beautiful descriptions of creation and essentially says: you're not in a position to judge. This isn't an argument; it's an existential confrontation.

Dostoyevsky, through the character of Ivan Karamazov, offered the most devastating literary version: even if suffering serves some ultimate divine plan, the torture of even one innocent child is too high a price. Ivan doesn't argue that God doesn't exist — he "returns his ticket" to a world built on children's tears.

The problem of evil remains philosophy's most emotionally charged argument — because it's not really about logic. It's about whether the universe is the kind of place that deserves our trust.
