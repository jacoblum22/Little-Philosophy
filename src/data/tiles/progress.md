Progress is the idea that things are getting better — that history has a direction, and that direction is forward. It's one of the most influential and contested ideas in modern thought.

For most of human history, people didn't believe in progress. The ancient Greeks looked backward to a Golden Age. Hindu cosmology describes vast cycles of creation and destruction. Christianity promised salvation, but in the next world, not this one. The idea that *this* world is steadily improving — that your grandchildren will live better lives than you — is distinctly modern, emerging in the Enlightenment of the 17th and 18th centuries.

Condorcet, writing during the French Revolution, articulated the vision most boldly: human reason, freed from superstition and tyranny, would produce unlimited improvement in knowledge, morality, and happiness. Science would conquer disease. Education would defeat prejudice. Democracy would replace despotism. The trajectory of history was clear.

Hegel gave progress a philosophical engine: the dialectic. History advances through contradictions — thesis generates antithesis, and their conflict produces synthesis, which becomes a new thesis. The process drives toward the realization of freedom. Marx materialized Hegel's dialectic: the engine of progress is not ideas but economic forces, and history advances through class struggle toward a classless society.

But the 20th century savaged the idea. Two world wars, the Holocaust, the atomic bomb, colonial genocide, environmental destruction — these made the Enlightenment faith in inevitable progress look naive at best, dangerous at worst. Adorno asked whether poetry was possible after Auschwitz. Walter Benjamin's "angel of history" sees not progress but a mounting pile of wreckage.

The honest assessment may be that progress is *possible* but not *guaranteed* — that moral and material improvement can happen, has happened, but is never permanent, never inevitable, and always vulnerable to reversal. Progress is not a law of history; it's a project.
