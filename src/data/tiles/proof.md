Proof is the demonstration that something must be true — not probably, not likely, but necessarily, following by inescapable logic from premises that cannot be denied.

In mathematics, proof is the gold standard. A mathematical proof begins with axioms (self-evident starting points) and proceeds through a chain of logical steps to a conclusion that is absolutely certain. Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, written around 300 BCE, is as valid today as it was then. No experiment can improve on it; no future discovery can refute it. This is the power of proof: it produces permanent, irrefutable knowledge.

But philosophy has a more complicated relationship with proof. Can you prove that God exists? Anselm, Descartes, and Leibniz thought so. Can you prove that the external world is real? Descartes tried and arguably failed. Can you prove that murder is wrong? Many have attempted it; none has produced a proof that achieves mathematical certainty. The question is whether the standard of mathematical proof applies outside mathematics — and if not, what counts as sufficient justification.

Gödel's incompleteness theorems revealed surprising limits even within mathematics: any consistent formal system powerful enough to express arithmetic contains true statements that cannot be proven within the system. Proof, it turns out, cannot capture all of mathematical truth. This humbled the foundationalist project that sought to ground all knowledge in proof.

The concept of proof also has a social dimension. In law, "proof" means something different than in mathematics: proof beyond reasonable doubt, proof by preponderance of evidence. In science, you don't prove a theory; you accumulate evidence that supports it until no better alternative exists. Each domain has its own standard of proof — and confusing them leads to errors: demanding mathematical proof for scientific theories, or mere probability for moral principles.
