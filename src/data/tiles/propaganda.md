Propaganda is the deliberate manipulation of information to shape beliefs, attitudes, and behavior — communication designed not to inform but to persuade, not to reveal truth but to serve power.

The word originally had a neutral meaning: Pope Gregory XV created the *Congregatio de Propaganda Fide* (Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith) in 1622 to spread Catholicism. But by the twentieth century, propaganda had become synonymous with systematic deception. The world wars and totalitarian regimes of the twentieth century turned propaganda into an art form — and a weapon. Joseph Goebbels's use of radio, film, and mass rallies in Nazi Germany showed how propaganda could not just influence opinion but manufacture consent for atrocities.

Philosophically, propaganda raises urgent questions about autonomy and rationality. If your beliefs have been shaped by propaganda, are they really *your* beliefs? Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman's *Manufacturing Consent* argued that even in democracies, media structures systematically filter information to serve elite interests — creating propaganda that's all the more effective because it doesn't feel like propaganda.

Hannah Arendt identified a particularly insidious form of propaganda: the kind that doesn't try to make you believe a specific lie but aims to destroy your ability to distinguish truth from falsehood at all. When nothing is certain, everything is possible for those in power. Jacques Ellul distinguished between "agitation propaganda" (designed to provoke action) and "integration propaganda" (designed to make people accept the status quo) — the latter being harder to detect because it aligns with what people already want to believe.
