Property is the right to control, use, and exclude others from a thing — a piece of land, an object, an idea. It seems natural and obvious ("this is *mine*"), but the philosophical justification for property is one of the most contested questions in political thought.

Locke gave the most famous defense: you own yourself, so you own your labor, so you own whatever you "mix" your labor with. The farmer who clears a field and plants crops has, by working the land, made it his own. But there's a famous proviso: this only works if there's "enough and as good" left for others. When all the land is taken, what happens to latecomers? They're forced to work on someone else's property, and the Lockean justification starts to look less like a defense of liberty and more like a defense of first-come, first-served.

Rousseau argued that property was the origin of inequality: the moment someone fenced off land and said "this is mine," civilization's problems began. Marx pushed this further: private ownership of the means of production creates a class system where the few exploit the many. Proudhon declared flatly: "Property is theft."

Defenders of property respond that without secure property rights, there's no incentive to produce, invest, or create. Hegel argued that property is essential for personhood — by putting your will into external things, you develop as a free being. The debate continues: is property a natural right, a social convention, a necessary evil, or a tool of domination? The answer shapes everything from housing policy to intellectual property law to the ethics of wealth.
