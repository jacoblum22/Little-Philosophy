Punishment is the deliberate infliction of suffering on someone because they have done something wrong — and the philosophical question is: what justifies doing this?

The two classic justifications pull in opposite directions. *Retributivism* says punishment is justified because the wrongdoer *deserves* it. You committed a crime; you owe a debt; justice requires that you pay. Kant was the most rigorous retributivist: even if a society were about to dissolve, its last act should be to execute its last murderer, because justice demands it regardless of consequences.

*Consequentialism* says punishment is justified only by its results: deterrence (others see the punishment and are discouraged from similar crimes), incapacitation (the offender is removed from society), and rehabilitation (the offender is reformed). Bentham designed his famous Panopticon — a prison where inmates could be observed at all times — on purely consequentialist grounds. Punishment that doesn't produce good outcomes is pointless cruelty.

These frameworks conflict in practice. A retributivist might support severe punishment for a crime that deterrence theory shows is unaffected by sentence length. A consequentialist might support punishing an innocent person if doing so would prevent greater harm. Neither theory, taken alone, satisfies our moral intuitions.

Foucault transformed the conversation in *Discipline and Punish*. The modern prison didn't emerge from philosophical principles but from new technologies of power. Pre-modern punishment was spectacular — public executions, brandings, mutilations — designed to display the sovereign's power. Modern punishment is private, bureaucratic, and aimed at the *soul*: reform, surveillance, normalization. The prison doesn't just punish criminals; it produces a whole system of knowledge, classification, and control.

The deeper question is whether any punishment system can be just in a society where crime is largely driven by poverty, inequality, and lack of opportunity. If the conditions that produce crime are unjust, what does it mean to "justly" punish the people those conditions produce?
