Purpose is the sense that your life, or some action, or the universe itself, is directed toward something — that things aren't just happening but happening for a reason.

Aristotle built purpose into the structure of reality through his concept of the final cause (telos). An acorn's purpose is to become an oak; a knife's purpose is to cut. Everything that exists has an inherent aim, and understanding something means grasping what it's for. This teleological worldview dominated Western thought for nearly two thousand years, until the scientific revolution stripped purpose from nature and replaced it with mechanism. Physics describes how things move, not where they're going or why.

This left humans in an awkward position. The natural world may have no purpose, but we can't stop experiencing our lives as purposeful. Viktor Frankl, drawing on his survival of Auschwitz, argued that the primary motivational force in humans is not pleasure (as Freud thought) or power (as Adler thought) but meaning — the search for purpose. Those who found purpose in the camps, even in the midst of unimaginable suffering, were more likely to survive.

The existentialists split on this. Sartre insisted that the universe provides no purpose — you must create your own through radical freedom. Camus asked whether life can have purpose even in an absurd universe and answered yes: we can choose to push the boulder, like Sisyphus, and find purpose in the pushing. Meanwhile, religious traditions have generally maintained that purpose is given, not invented — your purpose is to serve God, achieve moksha, follow the Dao, or fulfill your dharma.

The Japanese concept of ikigai — roughly, "a reason for being" — suggests that purpose is found at the intersection of what you love, what the world needs, what you're good at, and what sustains you. It's a practical answer to a question that philosophy has struggled with abstractly: not "does purpose exist?" but "how do I find mine?"
