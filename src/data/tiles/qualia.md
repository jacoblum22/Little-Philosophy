Qualia are the raw, subjective, "what it's like" qualities of conscious experience — the redness of red, the pain of pain, the taste of coffee as it actually tastes to you, right now.

You can describe the wavelength of light that produces red (around 700 nanometers). You can map the neural pathways that fire when someone sees red. You can give a complete physical account of what happens in the brain. But none of that captures what it *feels like* to see red — the vivid, private, qualitative experience that you have and nobody else can directly access. That subjective quality is a quale (plural: qualia).

Frank Jackson's famous thought experiment, "Mary's Room," makes the point vivid. Mary is a brilliant neuroscientist who has spent her entire life in a black-and-white room. She knows *everything* about the physics and neuroscience of color vision. Then one day she leaves the room and sees a red tomato for the first time. Does she learn something new? Most people's intuition says yes — she learns what red *looks like*. If so, then physical knowledge alone doesn't capture everything there is to know about consciousness. Qualia are something over and above the physical facts.

Thomas Nagel's "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" pushes the point further. A bat navigates by echolocation — it perceives the world through sonar. Even if we understood everything about bat neuroscience, we still wouldn't know what it *feels like* to be a bat. There is a subjective character to bat experience that is inaccessible from the outside. This suggests that consciousness has an irreducibly first-person dimension.

Physicalists push back. Daniel Dennett argues that qualia are an illusion — that once you've fully explained the functional and neurological processes involved, there's nothing left over to explain. The feeling that "something is missing" from a physical account is itself a cognitive confusion. Others, like David Chalmers, argue that qualia constitute the "hard problem of consciousness" — the question of why and how physical processes give rise to subjective experience at all. This may be the deepest unsolved problem in philosophy.

Whether qualia are real features of the world or philosophical mirages, they name something everyone recognizes: the fact that your experience has a quality, a texture, a *feel* that no amount of third-person description can quite capture.
