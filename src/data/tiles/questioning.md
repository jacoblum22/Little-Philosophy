Questioning is the act of putting things into question — refusing to accept received answers and insisting on understanding *why*. It's the engine of all philosophy, and perhaps the most distinctively human cognitive activity.

Socrates was the master of questioning. His method (the "elenchus") involved not making claims but asking questions — precise, relentless questions that exposed contradictions in his interlocutors' beliefs. When Euthyphro confidently declares he knows what piety is, Socrates asks a series of questions that leave him confused and contradicting himself. The goal is not humiliation but awakening: you can't pursue wisdom until you realize you don't have it.

Heidegger argued that questioning has a structure: every question has a "sense" (the direction it points in), something "asked about" (the topic), and something "asked" (the specific point of inquiry). What's crucial is that the question shapes what kind of answer is possible. Ask "how does gravity work?" and you'll get physics. Ask "why is there gravity at all?" and you're doing philosophy. The quality of your questions determines the quality of your understanding.

Gadamer emphasized that genuine questioning requires openness — you have to be willing to have your assumptions overturned. A real question is one whose answer you don't already know. This distinguishes philosophical questioning from cross-examination in court (where the lawyer knows the answer) or from rhetorical questions (which aren't really questions at all). To question authentically is to make yourself vulnerable to surprise, correction, and transformation.
