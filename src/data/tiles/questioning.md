Questioning is what happens when doubt becomes active — when you don't just sit with uncertainty but start actively probing, testing, and pushing at the boundaries of what you know. It's doubt in motion.

Questioning is the engine of philosophy. Socrates made it his entire method — not lecturing, but asking question after question until his conversation partners realized they didn't know what they thought they knew. The Socratic method is built on the power of questioning: the right question, asked at the right moment, can unravel an entire worldview and open the door to something deeper.
