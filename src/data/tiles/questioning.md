Questioning is the active pursuit of understanding — not just sitting with uncertainty, but probing, testing, and pushing at the boundaries of what you know.

Questioning is the engine of philosophy. Socrates made it his entire method — not lecturing, but asking question after question until his conversation partners realized they didn't know what they thought they knew. The Socratic method is built on the power of questioning: the right question, asked at the right moment, can unravel an entire worldview and open the door to something deeper.
