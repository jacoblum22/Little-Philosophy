Rationalism is the philosophical position that reason, not sensory experience, is the primary source of knowledge. The rationalist claims that some truths can be known purely through thinking — without ever looking at the world.

The paradigm case is mathematics. You don't need to go out and measure triangles to know that the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees. You can figure it out from your armchair through pure reasoning. Rationalists argue that some philosophical and metaphysical truths work the same way. Descartes, the most famous rationalist, tried to rebuild all of human knowledge on a foundation of pure reason. After doubting everything he could — his senses, the external world, even mathematics — he found one thing he couldn't doubt: the fact that he was doubting. "I think, therefore I am" (*cogito ergo sum*) became the bedrock of his system.

Spinoza and Leibniz continued the rationalist project. Spinoza tried to derive an entire ethical system using the geometric method — definitions, axioms, and proofs. Leibniz argued that all truths are ultimately truths of reason, even if finite minds like ours need experience to discover them. These thinkers trusted the power of the mind to penetrate reality more deeply than the senses ever could.

The great rival of rationalism is empiricism — the view that all knowledge ultimately comes from experience. The debate between them shaped modern philosophy, and Kant famously tried to synthesize both, arguing that experience provides the content of knowledge while reason provides its structure. Most philosophers today think neither pure rationalism nor pure empiricism works on its own, but the rationalist insight — that some truths can be known a priori — remains influential.
