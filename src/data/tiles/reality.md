Reality is the question that arises when consciousness meets the world: what is actually out there? Is the world as it appears to us, or is there a deeper reality hidden behind the surface? And how would we tell the difference?

This question — the nature of reality — is at the heart of metaphysics, the oldest branch of philosophy. Plato argued that the physical world we see is just a shadow of a higher reality of perfect, eternal Forms. Kant claimed we can never know "things in themselves" — we only ever experience the world as filtered through our minds. Idealists argued that reality is fundamentally mental. Materialists countered that it's fundamentally physical. And some philosophers, like the Zen Buddhists, suggested that the very question might be misguided — that reality is best understood not through thinking about it, but through direct experience.
