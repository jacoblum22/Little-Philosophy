Reality is whatever exists independently of what anyone thinks, believes, or wishes — the way things actually are, as opposed to how they merely appear.

Or so the realist says. The question of what is real turns out to be one of the hardest in all of philosophy. Plato argued that the physical world we see and touch is less real than the abstract Forms: a particular chair is a temporary, imperfect copy; the Form of Chair is eternal and perfect. The chair you're sitting on will eventually break; the idea of a chair cannot. Which is more real?

Aristotle countered that reality is right here, in the concrete world of particular things. Forms exist, but only as the organizing principles of physical substances, not in a separate realm. This debate between Plato and Aristotle — is the real the abstract or the concrete? — echoes through twenty-five centuries of metaphysics.

Modern philosophy added new complications. Kant argued that we never experience reality as it is in itself (the noumenal world) — we only experience reality as it's structured by our own minds (the phenomenal world). Space, time, and causation are not features of reality but features of human perception. This means the "reality" we know is always already shaped by the knower.

Indian philosophy has its own sophisticated approaches. Advaita Vedanta teaches that empirical reality is maya — not quite illusion, but not the deepest truth either. The only fully real thing is Brahman, the undifferentiated ground of being. Buddhist philosophy, through the concept of sunyata (emptiness), argues that nothing has inherent, independent existence — everything is real only in relation to everything else. Reality, in this view, is not a thing but a web of relationships.

The question persists: is there a reality independent of minds, or is reality inseparable from the minds that perceive it?
