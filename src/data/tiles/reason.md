Reason is the capacity to think logically, draw conclusions from evidence, and evaluate arguments — the mental faculty that (supposedly) distinguishes humans from other animals.

Western philosophy has traditionally placed reason at the pinnacle of human capacities. The ancient Greeks called humans "rational animals" and built their philosophical systems on the assumption that reason could, in principle, answer every important question. The Enlightenment doubled down: reason would replace superstition, tradition, and authority as the foundation of knowledge, morality, and governance. Kant declared that the Enlightenment's motto was "Sapere aude!" — Dare to think for yourself.

But reason has always had its critics. Hume delivered the sharpest blow, arguing that reason alone can never motivate action — passion must always come first. You might reason that exercise is healthy, but unless you desire health, that reasoning gives you no motive to move. Nietzsche went further, suggesting that what we call "reason" is often just a rationalization of deeper, unconscious drives. And postmodern thinkers like Foucault argued that appeals to "reason" have historically served to marginalize non-Western ways of knowing.

Non-Western traditions often give reason a different place. In Confucianism, reason operates within the context of relationships and ritual — it's not a solitary capacity but a social one. Buddhist logic developed rigorous formal systems but always in the service of liberation, not abstract truth. Indigenous epistemologies often integrate reason with observational experience, storytelling, and relational knowledge. The question isn't whether reason matters — it clearly does — but whether it's the master faculty the Western tradition claimed, or one valuable tool among many.
