Reconciliation is the restoration of a broken relationship — between individuals, communities, or nations. It goes beyond mere forgiveness (which one person can do alone) to require something mutual: both sides moving toward a new way of living together after harm has been done.

The concept has deep roots in religious thought. In Christianity, reconciliation is the restoration of the relationship between humanity and God, ruptured by sin. Paul's letters describe Christ as the agent of reconciliation: "God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself." In Judaism, the concept of *teshuvah* (return/repentance) involves not just inner remorse but concrete action to repair the damage done and restore the relationship.

The most striking modern example is South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu after the end of apartheid. The Commission was based on the principle that truth-telling — victims speaking their experiences and perpetrators acknowledging what they did — could create the conditions for genuine reconciliation. It drew on the African philosophical concept of *ubuntu* ("I am because we are"): the idea that the humanity of the perpetrator is diminished by their crimes, and that reconciliation restores everyone's humanity.

Philosophically, reconciliation raises difficult questions. Can some harms be so great that reconciliation is impossible or wrong to ask for? Does reconciliation require justice first, or can it sometimes replace justice? Hegel used "reconciliation" (*Versöhnung*) as a philosophical concept: history progresses through conflicts that are eventually reconciled at a higher level, with opposing forces integrated rather than simply resolved. Whether in personal relationships or political history, reconciliation is never the erasure of harm but the attempt to build something new that acknowledges and transcends it.
