Reflection is consciousness turned back on itself — thinking about thinking. It's what happens when wonder meets your own awareness, and you start examining not just the world but the way your mind works.

Reflection is central to philosophy. The ancient Greeks called it "contemplation" (theoria) and considered it the highest form of human activity. In modern philosophy, reflection became a method — Descartes used it to find certainty, Kant used it to discover the structure of the mind, and phenomenologists like Husserl used it to explore the nature of experience itself. Reflection is what separates mere opinion from genuine understanding: it's the discipline of stepping back and asking, "Is this really true, and how do I know?"
