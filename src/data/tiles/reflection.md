Reflection is the mind turning inward to examine itself — the act of thinking about your own thoughts, questioning your own beliefs, and asking whether the life you're living is the one you actually want.

Most of the time, we move through life on autopilot. We accept what we've been told, follow familiar routines, and react to situations without stopping to ask why. Reflection is what happens when that autopilot switches off. Suddenly you're not just thinking — you're thinking about the fact that you're thinking. You notice the assumptions you've been making. You wonder whether they hold up.

Socrates made reflection the heart of philosophy. His famous method — relentless questioning, exposing contradictions, refusing to let anyone rest on unexamined beliefs — was essentially structured reflection. He believed that most people lived in a kind of sleepwalk, accepting conventional wisdom without ever testing it. For Socrates, the point of philosophy wasn't to accumulate knowledge but to wake up.

Reflection appears across traditions in different forms. In Buddhism, the practice of mindfulness is a disciplined form of reflection — observing your own mental states without judgment. In the Confucian tradition, self-cultivation (xiu shen) requires regular honest assessment of your own character. Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic emperor, kept a journal in which he examined his daily failures and recommitted to his principles. What unites all these practices is the conviction that an unexamined mind is dangerous — to itself and to others.
