Regret is the painful awareness that you made a choice you now wish you hadn't — or failed to make one you wish you had. It's memory's judgment on choice, and one of the most philosophically rich emotions.

At its simplest, regret seems like a useless emotion: you can't change the past, so why torment yourself? The Stoics advised against it — what's done is done, and wisdom lies in accepting what has happened and acting well from here. But modern philosophers and psychologists have argued that regret serves a vital function: it's how we learn from mistakes. Without the capacity for regret, we'd repeat the same errors endlessly.

Bernard Williams connected regret to moral luck — the disturbing idea that our moral standing depends partly on factors outside our control. A drunk driver who makes it home safely and one who kills a pedestrian made the same reckless choice, but only one has cause for life-destroying regret. This suggests that regret tracks not just our choices but their outcomes, which seems unfair but also seems right: we do feel differently about identical choices with different results.

Kierkegaard captured regret's peculiar structure perfectly: "Marry, and you will regret it. Don't marry, and you will also regret it." For any significant life choice, there's a path not taken, a life not lived, an alternative self that haunts the actual one. Existentialists argue that regret is inseparable from freedom — only a being who can choose can regret. The question is not whether to feel regret but what to do with it: let it paralyze you, or let it teach you to choose more wisely.
