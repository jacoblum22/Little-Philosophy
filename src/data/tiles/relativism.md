Relativism is the view that truth, morality, or value depends on the perspective of the observer — that there is no "view from nowhere" from which to judge what's really true or really good. What's right in one culture, time, or framework may be wrong in another, and neither can claim ultimate authority.

Protagoras, the ancient Greek Sophist, declared that "man is the measure of all things" — making him one of the earliest relativists. If the wind feels cold to you and warm to me, there's no fact about the wind's temperature independent of how it strikes a particular person. Extend this to morality, and you get the claim that there's no moral truth beyond what a given individual or culture believes.

Moral relativism comes in different strengths. **Cultural relativism** observes that different societies have different moral codes — this is an anthropological fact. **Normative relativism** goes further, claiming that no culture's values are objectively better than another's. This sounds tolerant, but it leads to paradoxes: if relativism is true, you can't even say that tolerance is objectively better than intolerance, since "better" has no culture-independent meaning.

Critics from Plato onward have argued that relativism is self-defeating: the claim "there is no objective truth" is itself presented as an objective truth. And in practice, even committed relativists tend to make non-relative judgments — they condemn genocide, slavery, and cruelty in ways that clearly go beyond stating personal preference. Perhaps the most honest position is that relativism identifies a real problem (the difficulty of justifying universal moral claims) without offering a satisfying solution.
