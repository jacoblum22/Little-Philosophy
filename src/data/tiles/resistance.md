Resistance is the refusal to accept injustice — the act of standing against power that has become oppressive. It can take many forms: armed revolution, nonviolent civil disobedience, cultural preservation, artistic expression, or simply the quiet refusal to comply.

Foucault argued that resistance is inseparable from power itself: "Where there is power, there is resistance." Power doesn't flow in one direction from oppressor to oppressed; it circulates through networks of relationships, and at every point where it operates, resistance is possible. This means resistance is not just dramatic revolutionary moments but the countless everyday acts of non-compliance, subversion, and creative reinterpretation that keep power from becoming total.

The philosophical question of when resistance is justified goes back at least to the natural law tradition. Aquinas argued that unjust law is "no law at all" and that citizens are not bound to obey it. Locke formalized the right of revolution: when government systematically violates the rights it was created to protect, the people may resist. Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience" argued that individuals have a duty to resist unjust laws, not just a right.

Frantz Fanon's *The Wretched of the Earth* argued that for colonized peoples, violent resistance is not only justified but psychologically necessary — it's through the act of fighting back that the colonized person recovers the humanity that colonialism stole. Gandhi and King offered the opposite view: nonviolent resistance is both morally superior and strategically more effective. The debate between these positions is not merely academic — it shapes movements for liberation around the world.
