Respect is the recognition of another's worth — treating people as beings who matter in their own right, not merely as instruments for your purposes. It's one of the foundational concepts in ethics, but it comes in different forms with very different implications.

Kant gave respect its most rigorous philosophical formulation. His categorical imperative demands that you never treat rational beings merely as means to your ends but always also as ends in themselves. This means you can't lie to people, manipulate them, or use them without regard for their own purposes and autonomy. Respect, for Kant, is not a warm feeling but a moral duty — owed to every rational being regardless of whether you like them.

But respect has another sense: the recognition of particular excellences or achievements. You respect a master musician's skill, an elder's wisdom, a soldier's courage. This kind of respect is *earned*, not owed. The tension between these two senses — universal respect (owed to all) and particular respect (earned through merit) — runs through debates about equality, hierarchy, and recognition.

Confucian philosophy organizes respect through the framework of the five cardinal relationships (*wu lun*): ruler and subject, parent and child, husband and wife, elder and younger, friend and friend. Each relationship has appropriate forms of respect. The concept of *li* (ritual propriety) ensures that respect is not just internal feeling but embodied in concrete actions — how you greet, how you speak, how you serve. Respect, in the Confucian tradition, is not an abstraction but a practice woven into the fabric of everyday life.
