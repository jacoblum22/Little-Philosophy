Responsibility is the idea that your actions are yours — that you are answerable for what you do and, sometimes, for what you fail to do.

This sounds uncontroversial, but the philosophical depth is immense. Under what conditions is someone truly responsible? You need to have acted freely (not under coercion), knowingly (not in ignorance), and deliberately (not by accident). Aristotle laid out these conditions in the *Nicomachean Ethics*, and most legal systems still follow his basic framework. But each condition opens further questions. How free are we really, given our upbringing, psychology, and social forces? How much do we need to know before ignorance stops being an excuse?

The existentialists pushed responsibility to its extreme. For Sartre, you are responsible not just for your actions but for who you are — your character, your values, your situation. You can't blame your nature, your parents, or your circumstances, because you are always choosing how to respond to them. This "radical responsibility" is terrifying (hence Sartre's line about being "condemned to be free"), but it's also liberating, because it means nothing about you is fixed unless you let it be.

Emmanuel Levinas took responsibility in a different direction: we are responsible not primarily for ourselves but *for the other person*. The face of the other makes an infinite ethical demand on us — a demand we didn't choose and can never fully meet. Responsibility, on this view, is not a burden we pick up but one we are born with. It's the foundation of ethics itself.
