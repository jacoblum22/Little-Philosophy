Revolution is the sudden, fundamental overthrow of an existing political order — the moment when the governed decide they will no longer be governed as they have been.

Revolutions are rare and extreme. Most political change is incremental: a new law here, a reform there. Revolution rejects incrementalism. It says: the existing system is not broken in a way that can be fixed; it must be replaced. The American, French, Haitian, Russian, and Chinese revolutions each began from the conviction that the old order was beyond repair.

The philosophical debate about revolution begins with the question of legitimacy. When is revolution justified? Locke argued that when a government violates the natural rights of its people — life, liberty, and property — the social contract is broken, and the people have a right to rebel. This argument directly influenced the American Revolution. Jefferson echoed Locke nearly word for word in the Declaration of Independence.

Marx transformed the concept. Revolution, for Marx, wasn't a political choice but a historical necessity. Capitalist contradictions — the accumulation of wealth at one pole and misery at the other — would inevitably produce a proletarian revolution. The oppressed class wouldn't choose to revolt; the structure of the system would *force* revolution as surely as pressure forces an eruption.

But revolutions have a dismal track record. Arendt, in *On Revolution*, distinguished between the American Revolution (which succeeded in creating lasting institutions of freedom) and the French Revolution (which devoured its own children in the Terror). The bitter pattern repeats: revolutions made in the name of liberation often produce new tyrannies. The revolutionary vanguard becomes the new ruling class. Power corrupts the liberators.

Fanon explored this dynamic in the colonial context. In *The Wretched of the Earth*, he argued that revolution against colonial rule requires violence — not because violence is good, but because colonialism is a system of violence that cannot be dismantled politely. Yet he also warned that national liberation without social transformation simply replaces white oppressors with a native bourgeoisie.

Revolution is the most dramatic gamble in political life: the bet that destruction can lead to creation, that tearing down can be a form of building.
