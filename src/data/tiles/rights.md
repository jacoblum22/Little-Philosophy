Rights are claims that individuals can make against others — or against the state — that are supposed to hold even when it would be convenient to override them. They're the moral trump cards of political life.

The idea of natural rights was revolutionary when Locke articulated it in the 17th century. People have rights to life, liberty, and property not because any government grants them but because they are *natural* — built into the human condition, prior to any social arrangement. Government exists to protect these rights, and when it fails, the people can replace it. This idea fueled both the American and French Revolutions.

But where do rights come from? The Declaration of Independence says the Creator endows them. Locke grounded them in natural law. The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) simply *declares* them, asserting that they follow from "the inherent dignity" of human beings. Each grounding has been challenged. If there's no Creator, the theological ground collapses. Natural law has been criticized since Hume's is-ought problem: you can't derive how things *should be* from how they *are*. And dignity, while powerful as a concept, is notoriously hard to define.

Bentham dismissed natural rights as "nonsense upon stilts." For the utilitarian, the only thing that matters is the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Individual rights that stand against the collective good are irrational. Marx criticized rights differently: they're the rights of the isolated bourgeois individual, protecting private property and competitive self-interest while masking structural exploitation. The "right to property" protects the propertied; the "right to freedom" protects the freedom of the powerful.

Despite these critiques, rights remain the dominant language of moral and political argument worldwide. The most interesting contemporary debates concern *which* rights exist (do you have a right to healthcare? To housing? To a clean environment?) and how to handle conflicts *between* rights (does religious freedom override anti-discrimination law?).
