Ritual is a formalized, repeatable action invested with meaning beyond its practical function — a bridge between the mundane and the sacred, the individual and the communal.

Lighting candles on a birthday cake, standing for a national anthem, bowing at a shrine, sitting shiva, exchanging rings — these are rituals. Their power doesn't come from their practical effects (blowing out candles doesn't actually grant wishes) but from their *symbolic* significance, repeated performance, and communal recognition.

Confucius placed ritual (*li*) at the center of ethical and political life. For Confucius, ritual isn't empty formality — it's the medium through which human relationships are cultivated and expressed. Bowing to your teacher, pouring tea for a guest, mourning the dead with proper ceremony — these actions shape the character of the person performing them. You become virtuous by *practicing* virtue through ritual, the way a musician becomes skilled by practicing scales. The form isn't separate from the content; the form *creates* the content.

Durkheim, the founder of sociology, argued that ritual is the mechanism by which society constitutes itself. In collective rituals — religious ceremonies, festivals, even sporting events — individuals experience themselves as part of something larger. This "collective effervescence" generates the sense of the sacred, which is really the sense of social belonging projected onto objects, places, and beliefs.

Wittgenstein cautioned against explaining ritual away. When Frazer's *Golden Bough* treated rituals as failed science — primitive people burning effigies because they mistakenly believe it will affect the real person — Wittgenstein objected. Ritual is not a hypothesis about the world; it's an *expression* of something in human nature. We kiss photographs of loved ones not because we think the photograph has feelings but because the gesture satisfies something deep in us.

The modern world has largely secularized, but it hasn't eliminated ritual — it has displaced it. Graduations, weddings, New Year's countdowns, the rituals of fandom and sport — the human need for repeated, symbolic, communal action persists, even when the traditional religious frameworks have faded.
