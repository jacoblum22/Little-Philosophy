Sacrifice is the act of giving up something valuable — comfort, safety, life itself — for the sake of something you value more. It's the human capacity to choose loss in the name of a higher good.

The word comes from the Latin *sacrificium*: to make sacred. In its oldest meaning, sacrifice is a religious act — offering something to the gods. The temple sacrifices of ancient Israel, the fire rituals of Vedic India, the bloodlettings of Mesoamerica, the hecatombs of ancient Greece — all express the intuition that the sacred requires giving something up. You can't receive without releasing. The gift must cost the giver.

But sacrifice extends far beyond ritual. A parent who works exhausting hours so their child can attend school is making a sacrifice. A soldier who dies defending others is making a sacrifice. A whistleblower who destroys their career to expose corruption is making a sacrifice. In each case, the structure is the same: something of personal value is surrendered for something that transcends the self.

Philosophically, sacrifice raises a puzzle. If someone sacrifices their life for others, was that rational? From a purely self-interested perspective, no — you're dead, and the dead don't benefit. Evolutionary biology tries to explain it through kin selection and reciprocal altruism. But the traditions that honor sacrifice — virtually all of them — insist that it reveals something beyond calculation: a capacity to value others' good as one's own, or to serve a principle more important than survival.

Kierkegaard placed sacrifice at the center of faith through the story of Abraham and Isaac. God commands Abraham to sacrifice his only son. Abraham obeys — not because it makes sense, but precisely because it doesn't. This is the "leap of faith": the willingness to sacrifice what you love most, trusting that the demand comes from a source beyond reason's reach.

The danger of sacrifice is glorification. Cultures that romanticize sacrifice can create pressure to suffer needlessly, to accept exploitation as noble self-giving. The question is always: sacrifice for *what*, demanded by *whom*, and at whose expense?
