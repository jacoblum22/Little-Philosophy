Salvation is deliverance — being rescued from some fundamental predicament that you can't escape on your own. Every major religious and philosophical tradition identifies a core problem of human existence, and salvation is the name for its resolution.

In Christianity, the predicament is sin — humanity's estrangement from God through disobedience. Salvation comes through grace, specifically through the death and resurrection of Christ. Theological debates over whether salvation requires faith alone (Luther's *sola fide*), or faith combined with good works (the Catholic position), shaped the entire history of Western civilization. Can you earn salvation? Or is it purely a gift? The question goes to the heart of human agency and divine sovereignty.

In Buddhism, the predicament is *dukkha* (suffering or unsatisfactoriness), caused by ignorance and craving. Liberation (*nirvana*) comes through the Eightfold Path — right understanding, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. Crucially, the Buddha insisted that salvation is achievable through human effort, not divine intervention: "Work out your own salvation. Do not depend on others."

In Hinduism, salvation (*moksha*) is liberation from the cycle of rebirth (*samsara*), achieved through knowledge (*jnana*), devotion (*bhakti*), or selfless action (*karma yoga*). Existentialists offered a secular version: salvation from bad faith — from the inauthenticity of living by other people's expectations. Across traditions, the structure is similar: diagnose the fundamental illness, then prescribe the cure. The disagreements are about what's wrong and how to fix it.
