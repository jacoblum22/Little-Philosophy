Samsara is the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that, according to Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions, all sentient beings are caught in — a wheel that keeps turning until you find the way off.

The word means "wandering" or "flowing together" in Sanskrit. It suggests not a linear journey from point A to point B but an endless circling — life after life after life, driven by karma (the consequences of past actions) and propelled by *tanha* (craving) or *avidyā* (ignorance). You die, and the momentum of your unsatisfied desires and unexhausted karma carries the process forward into a new birth. The new life might be better or worse, human or animal, heavenly or hellish — but it's still samsara, still the wheel.

In Hindu philosophy, the mechanics of samsara are tied to the doctrine of atman — the eternal soul that transmigrates from body to body. What you do in this life shapes the conditions of the next. The goal of Hindu spiritual practice is moksha — liberation from the cycle, typically through the realization that atman is identical with Brahman, the ultimate reality.

Buddhism accepts samsara but rejects atman. There is no eternal soul that transmigrates — what passes from life to life is more like the flame of one candle lighting another. The continuity is causal, not substantial. The Buddha's diagnosis is precise: samsara is driven by the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, a chain of causes beginning with ignorance and ending with suffering. Break any link — especially ignorance and craving — and the chain falls apart.

Jainism offers yet another view: every soul (*jīva*) is naturally omniscient and blissful, but it's weighed down by accumulated karma-matter. Samsara continues until this karmic weight is burned off through ascetic practice.

Samsara raises a question that resonates even outside these traditions: are you living the same patterns over and over? Are your habits, reactions, and attachments creating a cycle you can't escape? The insight of samsara isn't only metaphysical — it's psychological. We all have our wheels.
