Sankofa is the Akan concept from Ghana that teaches: go back and fetch what you have lost. To move forward wisely, you must first reclaim the knowledge and traditions of the past.

The word comes from the Akan language of the Ashanti people and is often represented by a bird with its head turned backward, taking an egg from its back. The image is powerful: you can move forward while looking back. The past is not a burden to shed but a resource to carry with you.

This is more than nostalgia. In Akan philosophy, the past contains accumulated wisdom — tested solutions, refined values, understood relationships — that the present ignores at its peril. Elders aren't just old people; they're living libraries. Traditions aren't just habits; they're crystallized intelligence. Sankofa says: before you rush into the future, make sure you haven't left behind something you're going to need.

The concept gained particular urgency in the context of the African diaspora. The transatlantic slave trade systematically severed millions of people from their cultural roots — their languages, religions, histories, and traditions. Sankofa became a call to reclaim and reconstruct that severed heritage. It's an act of resistance against cultural erasure and a refusal to accept that what was taken is gone forever.

Philosophically, sankofa challenges the Western assumption that progress means moving away from the past. The Enlightenment tradition tends to treat the past as a darkness overcome by reason. Sankofa says the past may contain light that the present has lost. This resonates with thinkers like Alasdair MacIntyre, who argues that moral traditions carry accumulated practical wisdom that abstract rationality alone cannot replace.

Sankofa also speaks to any situation where a community or individual has lost touch with something essential. What have you forgotten that you need to go back for? What wisdom did you once have that you've abandoned in the rush to be modern, efficient, or new?
