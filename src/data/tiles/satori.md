Satori is the Zen Buddhist term for sudden awakening — a flash of insight in which you see reality directly, without the filter of conceptual thought.

Unlike the gradual enlightenment (*bodhi*) described in some Buddhist traditions, satori is dramatic and instantaneous. One moment you're struggling with a koan, sitting in meditation, or washing dishes — and the next moment, something shifts. The conceptual grid through which you normally perceive the world drops away, and you see things as they are. Not differently — more clearly. As the Zen saying goes: "Before enlightenment, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers. During practice, mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers. After enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and rivers are once again rivers."

The Rinzai school of Zen particularly emphasizes satori as the goal of practice. The student works with koans (paradoxical questions) under a teacher's guidance, building up a kind of intellectual pressure that eventually breaks through the mind's habitual categories. The Rinzai tradition values the shock of sudden insight — the lightning-flash moment when understanding arrives not through logic but through direct seeing.

The Sōtō school, founded by Dōgen, takes a different approach. Dōgen taught *shikantaza* ("just sitting") — that meditation itself is enlightenment, not a means to it. Satori isn't a dramatic experience to be pursued; it's the natural state of awareness that zazen reveals. Practice and realization aren't two things; they're one.

What makes satori philosophically interesting is its claim about the relationship between understanding and effort. Western philosophy generally assumes that insight comes through careful reasoning — you build arguments, examine evidence, and gradually arrive at conclusions. Satori suggests that the deepest insight comes when you stop building and let the constructions fall. It's not anti-intellectual — Zen monks study rigorously. But it insists that intellectual understanding, at a certain point, must be transcended.

Satori is always described as coming with a sense of returning home — not discovering something alien but recognizing something that was always already there.
