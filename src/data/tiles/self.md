The self is where all philosophy begins — the "I" that thinks, feels, wonders, and asks questions. Before we can ask what the world is made of, or how we should treat others, we first have to notice that there is a "we" doing the asking.

What exactly the self is, though, is one of the deepest questions in philosophy. Is it a soul? A brain? A bundle of experiences? Or just a useful illusion? Different traditions have given radically different answers — from the Hindu concept of Atman (an eternal inner self) to the Buddhist teaching of Anatta (no fixed self at all).
