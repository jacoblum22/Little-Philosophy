The Self is the starting point of all philosophy — the awareness that says "I exist." Before you can wonder about the world, you have to notice that there's a "you" doing the wondering.

But what is the self, exactly? This question may sound simple, but it has haunted philosophers for thousands of years. Is the self your body? Your mind? Your memories? Some deeper soul or essence that would persist even if everything else changed? Or is the self just an illusion — a story we tell ourselves to make sense of the chaos of experience?

Different traditions give radically different answers. In the Western tradition, thinkers from Descartes to the existentialists have tried to pin down what makes you "you." In Hindu philosophy, the true self (Atman) is said to be identical with the ultimate reality of the universe. In Buddhism, the concept of anatta teaches that there is no permanent self at all — just a constantly shifting stream of experience. And in many Indigenous traditions, the self is not an isolated individual but part of a web of relationships with family, community, and the natural world.

What's remarkable is that everyone agrees the self is worth investigating. It's the one thing you can never get away from — and yet the closer you look, the harder it is to find.
