Sin is a transgression against the moral or divine order — not just a mistake or a crime, but a violation of something sacred. While "wrongdoing" is a universal human concept, sin specifically carries the weight of spiritual failure, a rupture in one's relationship with the good, with others, or with God.

In Christian theology, sin is the central problem of human existence. The doctrine of original sin, developed most fully by Augustine, holds that all humans inherit a fallen condition from Adam and Eve's disobedience in Eden. We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners. This means the problem runs deeper than bad behavior — it's a fundamental disorder of the will, a tendency to place the self at the center of things where God should be. Augustine's introspective genius was in recognizing this tendency in himself: his *Confessions* catalog the subtle ways the ego corrupts even our best intentions.

Other traditions have analogous concepts without using the word "sin." In Buddhism, the root problem is *avijja* (ignorance) and *tanha* (craving) rather than moral rebellion. In Judaism, *chet* (the most common Hebrew word for sin) literally means "missing the mark" — falling short of what you could be, not necessarily cosmic rebellion. Islam treats sin as forgetfulness (*ghaflah*) of one's covenant with God, correctable through repentance (*tawbah*).

Philosophically, the concept of sin raises the question of moral psychology: why do people do what they know to be wrong? Socrates thought wrongdoing was always a form of ignorance — no one does evil willingly. Augustine and Paul disagreed: "I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do — this I keep on doing." The experience of knowing the right thing and failing to do it is, for many, the deepest evidence of something broken in human nature.
