Skepticism is the philosophical position that we should suspend judgment because our grounds for believing things are never as solid as we think.

Every philosophical tradition has its skeptics — the people who raise their hands and say, "But how do you *know*?" Far from being merely contrarian, skepticism has been one of the most productive forces in the history of thought, precisely because it forces everyone else to defend their claims.

Ancient Greek skepticism came in two varieties. The Academic skeptics (from Plato's Academy under Arcesilaus and Carneades) argued that certainty is impossible, but we can still act on probabilities. The Pyrrhonian skeptics went further: even the claim that "we can't know anything" is too confident. *Isostheneia* — the equal strength of opposing arguments — leads to *epochē* (suspension of judgment), which leads, paradoxically, to *ataraxia* (tranquility). Stop trying to be certain, and you'll finally be at peace.

Sextus Empiricus, our main source for Pyrrhonism, developed an arsenal of skeptical arguments. The "modes" (tropes) show how the same thing appears differently to different people, different senses, different cultures, different circumstances. Since we have no neutral standpoint from which to determine which appearance is correct, we should suspend judgment about how things really are.

Modern skepticism begins with Descartes, who used it as a method rather than a conclusion. His radical doubt — doubting everything that could conceivably be doubted — was designed to find something indubitable. He found it in the cogito. But Hume's skepticism was harder to escape. We can't prove that the future will resemble the past, that causes produce effects, or that the external world exists independently of perception. These beliefs are habits, not knowledge.

Contemporary skepticism raises questions about the scope and reliability of our cognitive faculties. Are we brains in vats? Are our memories reliable? Can science give us truth or only useful predictions? Skepticism doesn't require you to believe nothing. It requires you to take seriously the question of *why* you believe what you do.
