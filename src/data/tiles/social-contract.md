The social contract is the idea that political authority isn't natural or divine — it's an agreement, real or hypothetical, between the people and those who govern them.

Why should you obey the law? Because God says so? Because the king has divine right? Because the strongest take what they can? None of these answers satisfied the social contract thinkers. Their radical proposal was that legitimate authority must come from the consent of the governed. You obey because you have reasons to agree to the arrangement — and if the arrangement stops being reasonable, your obligation to obey weakens.

Hobbes started from the darkest premise. Without government — in the "state of nature" — life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." People would live in constant fear of violent death. To escape this, rational individuals would agree to surrender their freedom to an absolute sovereign (the Leviathan) in exchange for security. Almost any government is better than no government.

Locke was more optimistic. The state of nature isn't war; it's a condition of freedom governed by natural law. People have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. Government exists to protect these rights, and if it fails, the people have the right to revolt. This theory directly influenced the American Declaration of Independence.

Rousseau transformed the idea again. The social contract isn't just a deal for mutual protection — it's the creation of a new kind of freedom. In the state of nature, you're free but vulnerable. Through the social contract, individuals unite to form a collective body governed by the "general will" — the common good as determined by citizens deliberating together. This civil freedom, Rousseau argued, is actually *higher* than natural freedom, because it's rational and self-chosen.

Critics have asked: when exactly did we sign this contract? Hume pointed out that most people are born into political systems they never consented to. Feminist and postcolonial thinkers have shown that the "social contract" historically excluded women, non-white people, and non-property-owners. Carole Pateman's *The Sexual Contract* argues that the original contract was built on the subordination of women. Charles Mills's *The Racial Contract* shows how it was built on white supremacy.

Despite these critiques, the social contract remains the foundation of modern democratic theory — the idea that power is only legitimate when it serves the people it governs.
