Society is what emerges when multiple beings share a world. It's more than just a group of individuals — it's the web of relationships, rules, customs, and institutions that people create when they live together.

Why do we form societies at all? Some philosophers, like Thomas Hobbes, argued that without society, life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" — we band together out of fear and self-interest. Others, like Aristotle, believed that humans are naturally social creatures who can only flourish in community. Either way, society raises profound questions: Who gets to make the rules? What do we owe each other? Can a society be just?
