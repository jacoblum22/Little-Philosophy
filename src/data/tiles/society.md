Society is what happens when individuals come together and create something larger than themselves — shared rules, shared stories, shared ways of being.

No human being has ever lived entirely alone. Even the most rugged individualist was raised in a family, learned a language invented by others, and uses tools developed over generations. Society is the invisible infrastructure that makes human life possible. But it's also a source of deep philosophical puzzles. If society shapes who we are — our values, our beliefs, our sense of right and wrong — then how much of what we call "individual choice" is really our own?

Political philosophers have argued about the foundations of society for millennia. Hobbes imagined life without society — the "state of nature" — as a war of all against all, making any government better than none. Rousseau turned this on its head: humans are naturally good, and it's society that corrupts them. Confucius saw society not as a necessary evil or a corrupting force but as the natural expression of human relationships — the family writ large. Marx argued that the shape of society is determined by its economic structure, and that ideas about justice and morality are just reflections of who holds power.

The question that runs through all social philosophy is this: does society exist for the individual, or does the individual exist for society? Liberalism answers one way, communitarianism another, and most real human lives are lived somewhere in the tension between the two.
