Socrates is the philosopher who changed everything — not by writing books or building systems, but by asking questions. Walking the streets of Athens, he would approach anyone — politicians, generals, craftsmen — and ask them seemingly simple questions: "What is justice?" "What is courage?" "What is the good life?" Then, through careful questioning, he would show them that they didn't really know what they thought they knew.

Socrates wrote nothing. Everything we know about him comes from his students, especially Plato. But his influence is immeasurable. He transformed philosophy from abstract speculation about the cosmos into a practical pursuit of wisdom and self-knowledge. His method — relentless questioning aimed at uncovering hidden assumptions — is still the backbone of philosophical inquiry today.

He was executed by Athens in 399 BCE, charged with "corrupting the youth" and "impiety." He accepted his death calmly, arguing that a philosopher should welcome death rather than abandon the pursuit of truth.
