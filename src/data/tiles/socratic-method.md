The Socratic Method is a way of seeking truth through dialogue — not by lecturing or asserting, but by asking a series of probing questions that expose contradictions, uncover hidden assumptions, and lead the other person to discover the answer for themselves.

How does it work? Socrates would begin by asking someone to define a concept — "What is courage?" The person would offer a definition. Socrates would then ask questions that revealed problems with the definition, forcing the person to revise, refine, or abandon it. This process (called "elenchus") continues until either a better understanding emerges or the person admits they don't know — which Socrates considered a form of progress.

The Socratic Method is not about winning arguments. It's about joint inquiry — two people thinking together, following the argument wherever it leads. It remains the foundation of philosophical dialogue and is still used in law schools, classrooms, and therapy today.
