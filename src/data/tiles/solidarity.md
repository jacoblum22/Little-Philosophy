Solidarity is the decision to stand with others — especially others whose suffering is not your own — because you recognize that your fates are bound together.

Solidarity is not the same as charity. Charity flows downward, from those who have to those who lack. Solidarity flows sideways, between people who recognize each other as equals facing a common struggle. The labor organizer who strikes alongside fellow workers, the ally who shows up at a protest for a cause that doesn't directly affect them, the nation that sanctions an aggressor on behalf of a victim — these are acts of solidarity.

The concept has deep roots in socialist and labor traditions. The motto "An injury to one is an injury to all" expresses the core insight: in a world of interconnected systems, no one's oppression is truly separate from anyone else's. Martin Luther King Jr. made the same point in his *Letter from Birmingham Jail*: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality."

Richard Rorty argued that the expansion of solidarity — the widening of the circle of people we consider "one of us" — is the story of moral progress. We don't achieve this through philosophical arguments but through literature, journalism, and testimony that help us *imagine* the experiences of people different from ourselves. Solidarity, for Rorty, is not discovered through reason but created through empathy and shared stories.

Durkheim distinguished between *mechanical solidarity* (the unity of similar people in traditional societies, bound by shared beliefs) and *organic solidarity* (the interdependence of different people in modern, specialized societies, bound by their mutual need for each other). Both are forms of holding together, but they work through opposite mechanisms.

The philosophical challenge of solidarity is its limits. Solidarity *with whom*? Universal solidarity — with all humanity — sounds noble but is hard to sustain concretely. Particular solidarity — with your class, your nation, your group — is motivating but can become exclusionary. The tension between the two is never fully resolved.
