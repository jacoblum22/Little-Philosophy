Solipsism is the philosophical position that only your own mind is certain to exist — that everything else (other people, the physical world, the entire universe) might be nothing more than a construction of your consciousness. It's the logical endpoint of radical doubt, and almost nobody actually believes it. But it's surprisingly hard to refute.

The problem starts with Descartes. If the only thing you can be certain of is your own thinking ("I think, therefore I am"), how do you get from there to knowledge of anything else? You experience other people only through your own perceptions. You can never directly access another person's consciousness. For all you know, everyone around you is a philosophical zombie — a being that looks and acts human but has no inner experience.

Solipsism is almost universally rejected, but the reasons for rejecting it are philosophically instructive. Wittgenstein argued that the very language you use to formulate solipsism presupposes a public, shared world of meaning — a "private language" is impossible. If solipsism were true, the word "solipsism" couldn't mean anything. Strawson argued that our concept of a person already includes both mental and physical properties; the idea of a purely mental being is parasitic on the concept of embodied persons in a shared world.

Perhaps the deepest response comes from phenomenology: consciousness is always consciousness *of* something. It's directed outward toward a world, toward others. Solipsism tries to shut consciousness inside itself, but consciousness doesn't work that way. The very experience of doubt, of wondering whether others exist, already involves a relationship with an otherness that pure solipsism can't account for.
