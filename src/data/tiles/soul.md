The soul is the supposed immaterial essence of a person — the "you" that exists beneath the body, behind the mind, and (in many traditions) beyond death.

Nearly every culture in human history has posited something like a soul. The ancient Egyptians had the ka and ba, aspects of the self that survived death. The Greeks had the psyche, which Plato described as tripartite: reason, spirit, and appetite. Aristotle dematerialized it further, defining the soul as the "form" of the body — not a separate substance but the organizing principle that makes a body alive. Hindu philosophy identifies the Atman as the true self beneath the surface personality — identical, according to the Upanishads, with Brahman (the ultimate reality). In Islam, the ruh (spirit) is breathed into the body by God and returns to God at death.

The philosophical questions cluster around a few issues. First, existence: does the soul actually exist? Materialists from Democritus to modern neuroscientists argue that everything about you — thoughts, feelings, personality, even consciousness — can be explained by physical processes in the brain. If that's true, there's nothing left for a soul to do. Descartes tried to defend the soul as a thinking substance distinct from the body, but the interaction problem has never been satisfactorily resolved: if the soul is immaterial, how does it cause physical effects?

Second, survival: if the soul exists, does it survive the death of the body? And if it does, is that really "you" surviving? If your memories, personality, and bodily experiences are stripped away, what remains — and would you want it to be you?
