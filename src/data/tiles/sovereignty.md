Sovereignty is the supreme authority within a territory — the power that answers to no higher power. Every political order rests on the question: who gets the final say?

The concept took its modern shape with Jean Bodin in the sixteenth century, who defined sovereignty as "the absolute and perpetual power of a commonwealth." For Bodin, a state needs one undivided source of authority, or it collapses into chaos. Thomas Hobbes pushed this further: the sovereign (whether a monarch or an assembly) must have unlimited power, because any limit on sovereignty is just a disguised transfer of sovereignty to whoever enforces the limit.

Rousseau transformed the concept by locating sovereignty not in a king but in the "general will" of the people. Popular sovereignty — the idea that legitimate government derives from the consent of the governed — became the foundation of modern democratic thought. But it raised new problems. What happens when "the people" disagree? Can the majority use its sovereign power to oppress a minority? And what about the sovereignty of nations over indigenous peoples whose land they occupy?

Carl Schmitt offered a darker insight: sovereignty is not really about laws and constitutions. It's about who decides when the rules don't apply — who declares the state of exception. This reveals the uncomfortable truth that every legal order rests on a decision that is itself outside the law. Sovereignty, at bottom, is about power — and the philosophical question is whether that power can ever be fully tamed by justice.
