Stoicism is the ancient philosophy built on a single, deceptively simple distinction: some things are up to you, and some things are not. Wisdom is knowing the difference.

Founded by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE in Athens, Stoicism became one of the most influential philosophical schools in the ancient world. Its practitioners included a former slave (Epictetus), a Roman senator (Seneca), and an emperor (Marcus Aurelius). The diversity is telling — Stoicism was designed to work in any circumstance, from the palace to the prison cell.

The core insight is about control. You can't control what happens to you — illness, insult, loss, death. You *can* control how you respond. Your judgments, your desires, your choices — these are yours. Everything else belongs to fate. Epictetus put it starkly: "It's not things that upset us, but our judgments about things." The same event — a rainstorm, a job loss, an insult — can destroy one person and leave another unmoved. The difference isn't the event; it's the interpretation.

This doesn't mean Stoics felt nothing. A common misunderstanding is that Stoicism demands emotional flatness. What it actually targets is *pathological* emotion — the disturbances that arise from false judgments about what matters. Grief at a loved one's death is natural. But believing that their death is an injustice committed against you by the universe — that's a judgment, and it's one you can examine and revise.

Stoic ethics is built on the idea that virtue — wisdom, courage, justice, temperance — is the only real good. Everything else — wealth, health, reputation — is "preferred indifferent": nice to have, but not necessary for a good life. A virtuous person in chains is doing better than a vicious person in luxury. This is a hard teaching, and the Stoics knew it.

Stoic physics provides the metaphysical backdrop. The universe is a rational, ordered whole — a living organism governed by *logos* (divine reason). Everything that happens is part of this rational order. When Stoics say "live according to nature," they mean: align yourself with the rational structure of the cosmos. Accept your role in the whole.

Two thousand years later, Stoicism has returned as one of the most popular practical philosophies in the modern world — because the problem it addresses (suffering caused by wanting things you can't control) has never gone away.
