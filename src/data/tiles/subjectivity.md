Subjectivity is the fact that every experience happens from a particular point of view — that there is always a "someone" to whom things appear, and the way things appear depends on who that someone is.

This seems obvious until you try to get past it. Science aspires to objectivity — descriptions of the world as it is regardless of who's looking. But every observation is made by a subject, from a particular location, with particular instruments and particular assumptions. Can you ever actually reach a "view from nowhere," as Thomas Nagel called it? Or is the attempt to escape subjectivity itself a kind of illusion?

Kierkegaard made subjectivity the heart of his philosophy: "Subjectivity is truth," he declared — not meaning that anything you believe is true, but that the deepest truths (about God, about meaning, about how to live) can only be grasped from the inside, through personal commitment, not through detached observation. You can study Christianity objectively for decades and never understand what faith means to the person who lives it.

Phenomenology, founded by Husserl and developed by Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, took subjectivity as its starting point. Rather than trying to get behind or beyond subjective experience, phenomenology investigates the structures of experience itself: how things appear, how perception works, how consciousness is always consciousness of something. The insight is that subjectivity is not a veil between you and the world but the very medium through which the world shows up.

The tension between subjectivity and objectivity runs through nearly every philosophical domain. In ethics: are moral judgments subjective preferences or objective facts? In aesthetics: is beauty in the eye of the beholder or in the object? In epistemology: is knowledge possible only from a subject's perspective, or can it transcend perspective entirely? The answer you give shapes everything else.
