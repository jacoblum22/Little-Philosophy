Substance is what underlies all properties and changes — the fundamental "stuff" that things are made of, the bearer of qualities that itself has no need of a further bearer.

Aristotle defined substance (ousia) as what exists in its own right, not as a property of something else. Redness exists in a ball; the ball doesn't exist in anything else — it's a substance. This seems straightforward until you start asking what a substance really is, stripped of all its properties. Take away the ball's color, shape, weight, and texture — what's left? If nothing, then substance is an empty placeholder. If something, then what?

Descartes identified two fundamental substances: mind (thinking substance) and matter (extended substance). Everything in the universe is one or the other. But this raised the interaction problem: how can two fundamentally different substances affect each other? Spinoza offered a radical solution: there is only one substance — God or Nature — and everything else (minds, bodies, rocks, stars) is a mode or expression of that single substance. This is monism: the view that reality is fundamentally one.

Leibniz went in the opposite direction: reality consists of infinitely many substances (monads), each a self-contained, windowless unit of experience. The appearance of interaction between substances is really a pre-established harmony set up by God.

Buddhist philosophy challenges the entire framework. The concept of sunyata (emptiness) holds that nothing has independent, substantial existence. What we call "substances" are really bundles of interdependent processes, temporarily stable but ultimately empty of inherent being. There is no substance beneath the properties — there are only properties all the way down. Whether this liberates us from a metaphysical illusion or leaves reality without a foundation is the question.
