Suffering is the experience of pain, loss, or anguish — the unavoidable companion of being alive in a world that doesn't always go the way we want it to.

Every philosophical and religious tradition takes suffering seriously, because no tradition can ignore the most basic fact of human experience: things hurt. People get sick, loved ones die, plans fail, injustice persists. The question isn't whether suffering exists — everyone already knows that. The question is what suffering means, and what we should do about it.

The Buddha made suffering (dukkha) the starting point of his entire philosophy. The First Noble Truth — "life is suffering" — doesn't mean that life is nothing but misery. It means that dissatisfaction, impermanence, and loss are woven into the structure of existence. As long as you crave things to be permanent in a world that isn't, you will suffer. The path to liberation, for the Buddha, runs through understanding and ultimately releasing that craving.

The Western tradition has taken a different approach. The Stoics taught that suffering comes not from events themselves but from our judgments about them — change your judgments, and you change your experience. Christianity gave suffering a redemptive meaning: Christ's suffering on the cross transforms pain into a path to salvation. The existentialists stripped away these consolations and argued that suffering has no inherent meaning — but that facing it honestly, without illusions, is the foundation of an authentic life.

What all these traditions share is a refusal to look away. The philosophical response to suffering is not to pretend it doesn't exist, but to ask: given that it does, how should we live?
