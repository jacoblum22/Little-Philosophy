Suffering is the awareness that the world contains pain, loss, and hardship, and that beings experience it deeply.

Suffering is central to many philosophical traditions. The Buddha's first teaching was that life inherently involves suffering (dukkha), and that understanding this is the first step toward liberation. The Stoics taught that suffering comes not from events themselves but from our judgments about them. Existentialists like Camus asked whether life is worth living at all in the face of suffering. Far from being a problem to avoid, suffering has been one of philosophy's greatest catalysts — pushing thinkers to ask the deepest questions about meaning, purpose, and the good life.
