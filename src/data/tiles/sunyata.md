Śūnyatā — emptiness — is the Buddhist teaching that nothing has inherent, independent, self-sufficient existence. Everything that exists is empty of a fixed, essential nature.

This is easily misunderstood. Emptiness doesn't mean "nothing exists." The table in front of you is real — you can put things on it. But its existence depends on countless causes and conditions: the wood it's made from, the carpenter who shaped it, the tree that grew the wood, the sun and rain that grew the tree. Remove any of these and the table doesn't exist. It has no table-ness independent of the web of relationships that produced it. It is, in the technical Buddhist phrase, *empty of inherent existence* (*svabhāva-śūnya*).

Nāgārjuna, the 2nd-century Indian philosopher and founder of the Madhyamaka school, developed śūnyatā into one of the most rigorous philosophical systems in history. His *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way) systematically demonstrates that no phenomenon — causation, motion, time, the self, even the Buddha's own teachings — can withstand analysis if assumed to have inherent existence. Everything arises through *pratītyasamutpāda* (dependent origination): everything depends on everything else, and nothing stands alone.

The Heart Sutra's famous declaration — "form is emptiness; emptiness is form" — captures the crucial point. Emptiness isn't opposed to the world of forms; it *is* the world of forms, correctly understood. Things appear, function, and have effects. They just don't exist in the fixed, independent way we habitually assume. This middle path between existence and non-existence is what "Madhyamaka" means — the middle way.

The ethical implications are profound. If the self is empty — if "I" am not a fixed, separate entity but a flowing process interdependent with all other processes — then the sharp boundary between self and other dissolves. Compassion becomes natural: your suffering and mine aren't separated by the hard wall of separate selves. This is why, in Mahāyāna Buddhism, wisdom (śūnyatā) and compassion (*karuṇā*) are always paired. You can't have one without the other.
