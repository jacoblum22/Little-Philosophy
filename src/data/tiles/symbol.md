A symbol is something that stands for something else — but unlike a mere sign, a symbol carries a surplus of meaning that can never be fully unpacked. A stop sign means "stop" and nothing more. A cross, a lotus, a flag — these mean far more than any single definition can capture.

Philosophers have distinguished symbols from signs in various ways. Charles Sanders Peirce classified symbols as signs whose connection to what they represent is purely conventional — there's nothing about the word "dog" that resembles an actual dog. But many symbols work through deeper resonances. Carl Jung argued that certain symbols are archetypal — they recur across cultures because they tap into shared structures of the human psyche. The mandala, the world tree, the hero figure — these appear everywhere because they express universal aspects of human experience.

Ernst Cassirer went further, arguing that humans are fundamentally *animal symbolicum* — symbol-making creatures. Language, myth, religion, art, and science are all "symbolic forms" through which we organize and give meaning to raw experience. We don't have direct access to reality; we always encounter it through the symbols we've built. This makes symbol-creation not a luxury but the basic activity of the human mind.

Paul Tillich, the theologian, argued that religious symbols "participate in the reality to which they point" — they don't just represent the sacred but make it present. A crucifix is not just a reminder of Christ; for the believer, it mediates an encounter with the divine. Symbols, on this view, are not decorations laid over a pre-existing reality but the means through which reality discloses itself.
