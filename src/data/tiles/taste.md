Taste is the capacity to appreciate beauty, quality, and aesthetic value — and the question of whether it's subjective (a matter of personal preference) or objective (responsive to real properties in things) is one of the oldest in philosophy.

"There's no accounting for taste" (*de gustibus non disputandum est*) — this common saying expresses the intuition that aesthetic judgments are purely personal. You like the painting; I don't. Neither of us is wrong. David Hume largely agreed: beauty is "no quality in things themselves" but a feeling in the observer. Yet Hume also recognized that some people have better taste than others — that the experienced wine taster detects qualities the novice misses. His solution was the concept of the "true critic": a judge of refined sensibility, broad experience, and freedom from prejudice.

Kant tried to resolve the paradox in the *Critique of Judgment*. Aesthetic judgments, he argued, are subjective (they're based on feeling, not concepts) but they claim universal validity (when you say something is beautiful, you don't mean it's beautiful only to you — you expect others to agree). This gives taste a special status: it's personal yet aspires to be shared, individual yet oriented toward community.

Pierre Bourdieu blew up the whole discussion by arguing that taste is fundamentally social. Your aesthetic preferences — the music you like, the food you eat, the art you hang on your walls — are markers of class position, not free expressions of individual sensibility. "Good taste" is whatever the dominant class values; "bad taste" is whatever they disdain. Taste, on Bourdieu's analysis, is a form of social power disguised as personal refinement.
