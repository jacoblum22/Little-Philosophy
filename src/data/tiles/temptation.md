Temptation is the pull toward something you believe you shouldn't do — the experience of wanting what conflicts with your values, principles, or better judgment. It only exists because humans are divided creatures: part reason, part appetite, part something in between.

Plato described the soul as a charioteer (reason) trying to control two horses — one noble (spirit), one unruly (appetite). Temptation is the unruly horse pulling toward pleasure, comfort, or gratification at the expense of what's good. Aristotle distinguished between the self-controlled person (who feels temptation but resists it) and the truly virtuous person (who doesn't feel the pull at all, because their desires have been educated to align with reason). On Aristotle's view, needing to resist temptation constantly is a sign that your moral education is incomplete.

Christian theology made temptation central to its understanding of human nature. The story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is, at its core, a story about temptation: the serpent offers knowledge, and the desire for it overrides obedience to God. Augustine's account of stealing pears as a youth — not because he was hungry but for the sheer thrill of doing something forbidden — explored the disturbing possibility that we sometimes want what's wrong *because* it's wrong.

The Buddhist tradition approaches temptation through the concept of *tanha* (craving) — the root cause of suffering. The Four Noble Truths teach that suffering arises from attachment to desires, and the path to liberation involves not suppressing desire through willpower but understanding its nature so thoroughly that its hold dissolves. Temptation, in every tradition, is the testing ground where moral knowledge meets moral practice.
