Testimony is knowledge gained from others' reports — from being told, reading, or otherwise receiving information secondhand. It sounds like a trivial category until you realize that the vast majority of what you "know" comes from testimony rather than personal observation: history, science, geography, current events, even your own name and birthday.

Traditional epistemology, from Descartes through the early modern period, was suspicious of testimony. Real knowledge should be based on your own reason and experience, not on trusting others. But this is absurdly demanding. You can't personally verify that the Earth orbits the Sun, that Napoleon existed, or that water is H2O. You learn these things because reliable sources told you.

C.A.J. Coady's *Testimony* revived philosophical interest in this neglected topic. He argued that testimony is a basic source of knowledge — not reducible to perception, memory, or reasoning but a distinct epistemic category. The question is: when should you believe what you're told? Reductionists say testimony is justified only when you have independent reasons to trust the speaker. Anti-reductionists argue that testimony has a default presumption of trustworthiness — you should believe people unless you have reason not to.

Miranda Fricker introduced the concept of "testimonial injustice": a wrong done to someone specifically in their capacity as a knower. When a woman's testimony is dismissed because of sexism, or a person of color's account is doubted because of racism, the injustice is *epistemic* — it attacks the person's credibility as a source of knowledge. This shows that testimony is not just an epistemological issue but a political one: who gets believed, and why, is a question of power.
