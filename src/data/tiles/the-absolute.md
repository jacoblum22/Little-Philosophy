The Absolute is the philosophical concept of ultimate, unconditioned reality — that which depends on nothing else for its existence and contains everything within itself. It's the final answer to the question "what is most real?" — the ground beneath all grounds.

In German Idealism, the Absolute took center stage. Fichte began with the absolute "I" — the self-positing consciousness that generates both itself and the world of experience. Schelling proposed the Absolute as the underlying unity of nature and spirit, subject and object, before their differentiation. Hegel gave the concept its most elaborate development: the Absolute is Spirit (*Geist*) progressively realizing itself through the dialectical movement of history. "The True is the whole" — you can't understand any part of reality (an idea, an event, an institution) without understanding how it relates to the total system.

In Indian philosophy, Brahman is the Absolute — the infinite, unchanging reality underlying all apparent diversity. Shankara's Advaita Vedanta argues that Brahman alone is real; the world of multiplicity is *maya* (appearance). The Absolute is not a distant God but your own deepest nature: "Tat tvam asi" ("You are That"). Realizing this identity is liberation.

Kierkegaard and other existentialists rejected the concept of the Absolute as a flight from the concrete, suffering, choosing individual. Hegel's system, Kierkegaard argued, explains everything except the one thing that matters: how an existing person should live. The Absolute gives you the view from eternity, but you don't live in eternity — you live in this moment, facing this choice. The tension between the Absolute and the individual remains one of the deepest faultlines in philosophy.
