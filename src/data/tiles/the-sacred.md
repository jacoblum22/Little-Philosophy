The sacred is the dimension of experience that feels fundamentally different from ordinary life — set apart, charged with meaning, demanding reverence. It can be located in a place (a temple, a mountain), a time (a holy day, a ritual moment), an object (a relic, a scripture), or an experience (a mystical vision, childbirth, death).

Rudolf Otto's *The Idea of the Holy* (1917) gave the most influential philosophical analysis. He described the experience of the sacred as the *mysterium tremendum et fascinans* — a mystery that is simultaneously terrifying and fascinating. Standing before the sacred, you feel both drawn in and overwhelmed, both insignificant and deeply connected. Otto argued this experience is *sui generis* — irreducible to anything else, not explainable as merely moral feeling, aesthetic beauty, or psychological projection.

Mircea Eliade distinguished the sacred from the profane as two fundamental modes of being in the world. For the religious person, the world is not homogeneous: some places are charged with power, some times open onto eternity. Sacred space is a "hierophany" — a break in ordinary reality where the transcendent becomes manifest. This is why temples are built on particular sites, why rituals are performed at particular times.

Émile Durkheim offered a sociological counter-theory: the sacred is whatever a society collectively venerates. A totem, a flag, a constitution — these become sacred not because of any inherent properties but because a community invests them with collective emotion. On this view, every society has its sacred objects, whether it recognizes them as religious or not. The philosophical question is whether the sacred points to something genuinely transcendent or is entirely a human creation.
