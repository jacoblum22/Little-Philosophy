Theodicy is the attempt to justify God's existence in the face of evil — to answer the question: if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good, why does suffering exist?

The problem is ancient and devastating in its simplicity. A child dies of cancer. An earthquake kills thousands. A genocide unfolds while the heavens are silent. If God could prevent this and didn't, God is not good. If God wanted to prevent it but couldn't, God is not all-powerful. If God didn't know about it, God is not all-knowing. The logical possibilities seem to eliminate the God of classical theism.

The term "theodicy" was coined by Leibniz in 1710, though the problem is far older — it structures the Book of Job, the Babylonian text *Ludlul bēl nēmeqi*, and millennia of theological reflection. Leibniz's own answer was that this is the "best of all possible worlds" — that God, surveying all possible creations, chose the one with the greatest ratio of good to evil. Voltaire savagely mocked this in *Candide*, especially after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake killed tens of thousands.

Other attempted solutions include: *free will theodicy* — evil results from human choices, and a world with free will is better than one without, even though it allows suffering; *soul-making theodicy* (John Hick) — suffering is necessary for moral and spiritual growth, the way resistance is necessary for building muscles; and *mystery theodicy* — God's ways are beyond human understanding, as God tells Job: "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?"

Each response has been challenged. Free will doesn't explain natural disasters. Soul-making doesn't explain the suffering of infants. Mystery feels like giving up rather than answering.

Some modern thinkers — Dostoyevsky's Ivan Karamazov, Albert Camus, and the post-Holocaust theologians — have argued that the very attempt at theodicy is morally obscene: explaining away the suffering of innocents is worse than admitting you have no answer. The honest response to the problem of evil may be protest, not explanation.
