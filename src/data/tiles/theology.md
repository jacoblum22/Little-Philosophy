Theology is the systematic study of the divine — the attempt to think rigorously about God, the sacred, and our relationship to both. If philosophy is the love of wisdom, theology is the love of wisdom directed specifically toward ultimate questions: Does God exist? What is God's nature? What does God want from us? How should we live in light of the divine?

Anselm of Canterbury defined theology as "faith seeking understanding" (*fides quaerens intellectum*) — not blind faith that avoids thinking but faith that actively pursues clarity. This defined the medieval project: thinkers like Aquinas, Maimonides, and al-Ghazali brought the tools of philosophy (logic, metaphysics, epistemology) to bear on the claims of revelation. Aquinas's *Summa Theologica* attempted to reconcile Aristotelian reason with Christian faith, producing one of the most ambitious intellectual systems in history.

The Enlightenment challenged theology by asking whether reason and faith are compatible at all. Kant argued that traditional proofs for God's existence fail, but that God remains a necessary postulate of practical reason — you need to believe in God to make sense of morality. Schleiermacher recentered theology on religious experience rather than doctrine: the "feeling of absolute dependence" is the core of religion, and theology is its reflective articulation.

Modern theology has moved in many directions: Barth's insistence on God's radical otherness, Tillich's theology of culture, liberation theology's focus on the poor, feminist theology's critique of patriarchal God-language. What unites them is the conviction that the ultimate questions are too important to leave unasked — even if (especially if) the answers remain elusive.
