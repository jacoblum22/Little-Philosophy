A theory is an organized system of ideas that explains some domain of reality — connecting observations, predicting outcomes, and making the world more intelligible. The word comes from the Greek *theoria*, meaning "contemplation" or "the act of seeing," and it carries the suggestion that understanding is itself a kind of vision.

Aristotle placed *theoria* (theoretical contemplation) at the highest rank of human activities — above practical action and productive making. For Aristotle, pure contemplation of truth is the activity that makes human beings most like the divine. This attitude persisted: Newton's laws, Einstein's relativity, and Darwin's evolution are called "theories" not because they're uncertain but because they're systematic, explanatory frameworks that illuminate vast domains of experience.

But the relationship between theory and practice is contested. Marx argued that theories are not neutral descriptions of reality but reflections of social interests: the ruling ideas of any age are the ideas of the ruling class. Feminist and postcolonial thinkers have pressed similar points: whose experience gets generalized into "theory"? Whose reality disappears when theory is formulated from a narrow perspective?

The philosophy of science has debated what theories actually are. Are they literal descriptions of unobservable entities (scientific realism)? Useful instruments for predicting observations (instrumentalism)? Models that partially represent reality without being literally true (model-theoretic views)? The answer determines what we mean when we say a theory is "true" — and how seriously we should take the unobservable entities (atoms, genes, black holes) that our best theories posit.
