A thought experiment is an imaginary scenario designed to test a philosophical principle. You don't need a laboratory — just a well-constructed hypothetical and the willingness to follow the reasoning wherever it leads.

Philosophy is full of famous thought experiments. Plato's Cave asks you to imagine prisoners who have only ever seen shadows on a wall — what would happen if one escaped into the sunlight? The Trolley Problem asks whether you would divert a runaway trolley to kill one person instead of five. Descartes's Evil Demon imagines a being who deceives you about everything — could you still know anything for certain? Each of these scenarios strips away real-world complications to isolate a single philosophical question in its purest form.

Why do they work? Because philosophy is not primarily about facts but about concepts — and concepts can be tested through imagination. If you claim that "killing is always wrong," I can construct a scenario where not killing leads to greater killing, and force you to refine your principle. If you claim that "identity depends on memory," I can describe a case of someone who loses all memory but seems to remain the same person, and you'll have to decide whether your theory holds.

Thought experiments have limits. Some are too artificial to tell us anything about real moral life — the Trolley Problem has been criticized for stripping away all the contextual and emotional complexity that actual ethical decisions involve. But at their best, thought experiments are philosophy's closest equivalent to a scientific experiment: controlled scenarios that reveal something about the structure of our concepts that ordinary experience leaves hidden.
