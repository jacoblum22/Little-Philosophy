Thought is the mind's activity of reasoning, reflecting, imagining, and forming ideas — the silent conversation you carry on with yourself every waking moment.

What is thought, exactly? Plato called it "the soul's conversation with itself" — an inner dialogue where you pose questions and consider answers without speaking aloud. Descartes made thought the foundation of everything: it was the one thing he couldn't doubt, because doubting is itself a form of thinking. "I think, therefore I am" doesn't just prove that you exist — it identifies you with your thinking.

But is thought essentially linguistic? Do you think in words, or are words just the packaging? Wittgenstein argued that the limits of your language are the limits of your world — that you literally can't think what you can't say. Others disagree: mathematicians report thinking in spatial intuitions, musicians in auditory patterns, and young children clearly think before they have language. The relationship between thought and language remains one of the most contested questions in philosophy of mind.

Heidegger pushed in another direction entirely. For him, the Western tradition had reduced thinking to calculation — to logic, problem-solving, and instrumental reasoning. But there is a deeper mode of thinking he called "meditative thinking" (besinnliches Denken): a patient, receptive attending to being itself, not trying to solve anything but simply letting what is reveal itself. This distinction between calculative and meditative thinking echoes across traditions — it's closely related to the Buddhist distinction between discursive thought (vitakka) and direct insight (vipassana).

The question that haunts any account of thought is its relationship to truth. Does thinking discover truths that are already there, or does it construct them? When you solve a math problem, are you finding something or making something? The answer determines whether thought is a mirror of reality or a creative act — or somehow both.
