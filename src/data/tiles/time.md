Time is the medium through which everything happens — the invisible current that carries all events from future to past, making change possible and permanence impossible.

Augustine's confession captures the paradox perfectly: we all know what time is until someone asks us to explain it. The past no longer exists. The future doesn't exist yet. The present is a vanishingly thin slice between them. So where, exactly, does time live? And what is it made of?

The ancient Greeks offered two competing views. Parmenides argued that time is an illusion — reality is eternal and unchanging, and the appearance of change is a trick of the senses. Heraclitus took the opposite view: time and change are the most fundamental features of reality. "Everything flows," he said. These two positions — time as illusion vs. time as essence — have echoed through philosophy ever since.

In Indian philosophy, time takes on a cyclical character. The Hindu and Buddhist concepts of samsara describe time as an endlessly repeating wheel of birth, death, and rebirth. This stands in stark contrast to the linear time of the Abrahamic traditions, where history has a beginning (creation) and an end (judgment). The difference matters enormously: linear time implies progress, a story going somewhere; cyclical time suggests that the same patterns repeat, and the goal is to break free of the cycle entirely.

Modern physics has made time even stranger. Einstein showed that time isn't absolute — it stretches and compresses depending on speed and gravity. Two people can experience genuinely different amounts of time, and neither is wrong. But physics tells us how time behaves, not what it is. The philosophical question remains: is time something "out there" in the world, or is it a structure imposed by the mind? Kant thought the latter. The debate continues.
