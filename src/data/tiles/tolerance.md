Tolerance is the willingness to allow beliefs, practices, or ways of life that you disagree with or even find distasteful. It sounds simple, but it's one of the most demanding virtues there is — because it asks you to restrain yourself precisely where you feel most strongly.

Why would anyone tolerate what they believe is wrong? The most common philosophical answer comes from the Enlightenment: because you might be wrong too. John Stuart Mill argued in *On Liberty* that silencing an opinion robs the human race — if the opinion is right, we lose the truth; if it's wrong, we lose the "clearer perception and livelier impression of truth" that comes from seeing it challenged. Freedom of thought requires tolerance as its precondition.

But tolerance has a famous paradox, identified by Karl Popper: if a society is tolerant without limit, it will eventually be destroyed by the intolerant. Unlimited tolerance of intolerance is self-defeating. This means tolerance can't be purely passive — it requires judgment about where to draw the line, which is exactly the kind of difficult moral reasoning that makes philosophy necessary.

Tolerance is also not the same as approval, indifference, or relativism. You can tolerate something while believing it's wrong. In fact, tolerance only makes sense for things you *do* find objectionable — you don't need to "tolerate" things you like. The word carries a kind of productive tension: I think you're mistaken, but I won't use force to stop you, because I respect your capacity to think and choose for yourself.
