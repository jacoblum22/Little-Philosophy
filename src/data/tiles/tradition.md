Tradition is what happens when a society's experiences are passed down through generations — stories, rituals, beliefs, and practices that carry the accumulated wisdom (and sometimes the accumulated errors) of those who came before.

Tradition plays a complex role in philosophy. Edmund Burke saw tradition as a repository of practical wisdom, arguing that the accumulated experience of generations is wiser than the reasoning of any individual. The Enlightenment, by contrast, challenged tradition, arguing that reason and evidence should trump inherited beliefs. Many non-Western philosophies place great value on lineage and transmission — in Confucianism, respect for tradition (li) is fundamental to social harmony. The question remains: when should we honor tradition, and when should we question it?
