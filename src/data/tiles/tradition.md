Tradition is the transmission of beliefs, practices, and ways of life from one generation to the next — the living chain that connects the present to the past.

Tradition often gets a bad reputation among philosophers, who tend to prize independent thinking over inherited wisdom. But tradition isn't just mindless repetition. It's the accumulated knowledge of generations — tested, refined, and passed on because it worked. When you speak a language, celebrate a holiday, or follow a moral principle, you're participating in a tradition, even if you don't think of it that way.

Edmund Burke, the founding figure of conservative thought, argued that tradition embodies a kind of collective wisdom that no individual thinker could match. The institutions and practices that have survived for centuries have done so because they serve deep human needs, even if no one can fully articulate why. To tear them down in the name of abstract reason is arrogant and dangerous. Burke didn't oppose change — but he favored evolutionary reform over revolutionary rupture.

The counterargument is clear: tradition can also preserve injustice. Slavery, caste systems, and the subjugation of women were all once defended as "traditional." The question is how to distinguish wisdom worth preserving from harmful habits that persist out of inertia. The Ghanaian concept of Sankofa — "go back and get it" — captures a nuanced position: look to the past not to preserve it uncritically, but to retrieve what's valuable for the future. Every tradition, in the end, was once an innovation.
