Tragedy is the art form built around the terrible things that happen when human greatness meets human limits.

The hero of a tragedy isn't a villain. That's what makes it tragic. Oedipus is intelligent, decisive, and devoted to his city. Antigone is courageous and principled. Hamlet is thoughtful and morally sensitive. They fall not because they're bad people but because the world presents situations with no clean way out — situations where every choice leads to suffering, and the qualities that make someone admirable are the same ones that destroy them.

Aristotle gave tragedy its first systematic analysis in the *Poetics*. A good tragedy, he argued, imitates an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude. Its hero experiences a reversal of fortune (*peripeteia*) due to a tragic flaw or error (*hamartia*) — not a moral defect but a miscalculation, a blindness, a failure to see what the audience can see. The audience feels pity (for the hero's suffering) and fear (that something similar could happen to them), and these emotions are purified through catharsis.

Hegel offered a different interpretation: tragedy arises not from individual flaws but from the collision of two equally valid ethical claims. In Sophocles' *Antigone*, Antigone's duty to family (burying her brother) conflicts with Creon's duty to the state (enforcing the law). Neither is simply wrong. The tragedy is that both are right, and the situation demands a choice that destroys something valuable whatever is chosen.

Nietzsche saw tragedy as the highest art form because it confronts the most terrifying truth — that suffering is not an aberration but a condition of existence — and somehow affirms life *despite* that suffering. The spirit of tragedy says "yes" to life, not because life is pleasant but because it is worth living even at its worst. The death of tragedy, Nietzsche feared, came with Socratic rationalism — the optimistic belief that reason can solve every problem and suffering is just an error to be corrected.

Tragedy matters because it refuses to look away from what is genuinely painful and irresolvable in human life — and it transforms that pain into something meaningful.
