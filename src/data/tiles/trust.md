Trust is what emerges when empathy meets the other — the willingness to rely on someone because you believe they understand you and will act in good faith. It's a leap beyond mere knowledge into something more personal and vulnerable.

Trust is foundational to almost every area of human life, from friendship to politics to the pursuit of knowledge. Philosophers have explored why trust is so difficult — and so necessary. Without trust, cooperation breaks down, societies fragment, and even conversation becomes impossible. Yet trust always involves risk: you can never be certain another person will keep their word. It's a kind of faith in the other that goes beyond what evidence alone can justify.
