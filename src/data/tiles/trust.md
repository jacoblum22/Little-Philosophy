Trust is the willingness to make yourself vulnerable to another person — to believe they will act in good faith even though you can't be certain.

Think about how much of your life depends on trust. You trust that food won't be poisoned, that drivers will stop at red lights, that your memory is roughly accurate. Without trust, every interaction becomes a calculation, every relationship a strategic game. Trust is the invisible foundation that makes social life possible.

But trust is philosophically fragile. It requires a leap beyond the available evidence. You can never fully know another person's intentions. Whether it's trusting a friend with a secret, trusting a government with power, or trusting your senses to report reality accurately, you're always going beyond what you can prove. This makes trust fundamentally different from knowledge — it's closer to faith.

Political philosophers have built entire systems around trust. Hobbes argued that without a powerful sovereign to enforce promises, no one would trust anyone, and society would dissolve into fear. Locke imagined a social contract based on mutual trust between the governed and their government — trust that can be revoked if the government betrays the people. Confucian philosophy places trust (xin) among the core virtues: a leader who loses the people's trust has lost everything that matters.

The deepest philosophical question about trust is whether it's rational. Can you provide reasons for trusting someone, or is trust always an act of will that goes beyond reason? And in a world where institutions, technologies, and information sources are increasingly complex and opaque, how do you decide what — and whom — to trust?
