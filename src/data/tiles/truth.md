Truth is the quality a statement has when it corresponds to the way things actually are — or at least, that's one way to think about it.

"What is truth?" is one of the few philosophical questions that made it into ordinary conversation — Pilate's question to Jesus has echoed through two millennia. And despite all that time, we still don't have a universally accepted answer. The simplest theory — the correspondence theory — says a statement is true when it matches reality. "Snow is white" is true if and only if snow is actually white. Simple enough, until you ask: what counts as "matching"? What is "reality"? And how do you check?

Competitors abound. The coherence theory says a belief is true when it fits consistently with your other beliefs. The pragmatist theory (William James, Charles Peirce) says truth is what works — a belief is true if acting on it produces successful results. The deflationary theory says "truth" isn't really saying anything at all beyond the statement itself: to say "'snow is white' is true" is just to say "snow is white."

The question of truth also has a political dimension. Nietzsche provocatively asked whether truth is just "a mobile army of metaphors" — useful fictions that societies maintain to preserve order. Michel Foucault explored how "regimes of truth" are created by power structures: what counts as true depends on who gets to define the terms. And in many non-Western traditions, truth is not primarily propositional (about sentences matching facts) but experiential — in Sanskrit, satya (truth) is connected to sat (being). Truth isn't something you state; it's something you are.
