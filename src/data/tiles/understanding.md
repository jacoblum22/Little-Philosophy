Understanding goes beyond merely knowing facts. It's what happens when experience and empathy combine — when you don't just observe something but genuinely grasp it from the inside, seeing how the pieces connect and why they matter.

Philosophers distinguish between different kinds of understanding. You can understand how something works (explanation), understand what it's like to experience something (empathic understanding), or understand why something is the way it is (comprehension). Hermeneutics, the philosophy of interpretation, argues that all understanding involves a kind of dialogue — between the reader and the text, the observer and the observed, the self and the other.
