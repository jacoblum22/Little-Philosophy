Utility is the value or satisfaction derived from an action or outcome — how much happiness, pleasure, or well-being it produces. In moral philosophy, utility became the foundation of an entire ethical system: utilitarianism, the view that the right action is whichever produces the greatest good for the greatest number.

Jeremy Bentham launched utilitarianism with a boldly simple idea: pleasure and pain are the "two sovereign masters" that govern human behavior, and the moral task is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain across all affected beings. He even proposed a "felicific calculus" — a method for precisely measuring the intensity, duration, certainty, and extent of pleasures and pains to determine the right course of action.

John Stuart Mill refined Bentham's view by distinguishing higher pleasures (intellectual, aesthetic, moral) from lower ones (bodily, sensory). "It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied," Mill argued — quality of pleasure matters, not just quantity. This saved utilitarianism from the charge of being a "philosophy of swine" but introduced the difficulty of comparing qualitatively different pleasures.

Utilitarianism faces persistent objections. It seems to justify sacrificing one person for the benefit of many — harvesting an unwilling donor's organs to save five patients, for instance. It treats all preferences as equally valid, including preferences based on prejudice. And it demands that you always maximize — any time you do something for yourself that you could have done for others more effectively, you're acting wrongly. Despite these challenges, utilitarian reasoning remains enormously influential in public policy, economics, and applied ethics.
