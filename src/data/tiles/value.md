Value is the property of being worth something — the quality that makes certain things, actions, or states of affairs matter, that makes them worth pursuing, protecting, or creating.

The fundamental question of axiology (the study of value) is where value comes from. Is something valuable because we desire it, or do we desire it because it's valuable? The subjectivist says value depends entirely on the valuer: nothing is good or bad in itself; it becomes good when someone cares about it. The objectivist says some things are genuinely valuable regardless of whether anyone recognizes it: justice is good even if no one values justice; cruelty is bad even if a society celebrates it.

Philosophers have also distinguished between intrinsic and instrumental value. Something has intrinsic value if it's good in itself (happiness, knowledge, beauty); something has instrumental value if it's good as a means to something else (money, tools, exercise). Most of the things we pursue have instrumental value — we want them for what they lead to. The philosophical question is whether anything has intrinsic value, and if so, what.

Nietzsche launched the most radical challenge to the concept. In his "revaluation of all values," he argued that the dominant values of Western civilization (humility, pity, equality) are not objectively good but are the values of the weak, imposed on the strong through what he called "slave morality." True value creation requires going beyond existing value systems and forging new ones. Whether this is liberation or nihilism depends on your perspective.

The question of value underlies virtually every other philosophical question. What should I do? (ethics) What is worth knowing? (epistemology) What is worth creating? (aesthetics) How should we live together? (politics) In each case, you're making judgments about what matters — and philosophy begins when you ask why.
