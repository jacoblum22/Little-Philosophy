Virtue ethics asks not "what should I do?" but "what kind of person should I become?" — and answers: the kind of person who does the right thing naturally, because it's who they are.

For most of Western moral philosophy's history, the dominant frameworks have been rule-based. Kant says: follow the moral law. Utilitarianism says: maximize happiness. Both focus on *actions* — which ones are right, which ones are wrong. Virtue ethics, revived in the 20th century after centuries of neglect, shifts the focus to *character*. A good person isn't someone who mechanically follows rules but someone who has cultivated the dispositions — the virtues — that lead to living well.

Aristotle is the founding figure. In the *Nicomachean Ethics*, he argues that every human activity aims at some good, and the highest good is *eudaimonia* — flourishing, or living well. Eudaimonia isn't a feeling (like happiness) but an activity: living in accordance with the virtues over a complete life. The virtues — courage, temperance, justice, generosity, truthfulness, and others — are each a "mean" between two extremes. Courage is the mean between cowardice and recklessness. Generosity is the mean between stinginess and extravagance.

Crucially, virtue can't be learned from a book. It requires *practice* — repeatedly choosing the virtuous action until it becomes second nature, the way a musician becomes skilled through years of performance. This is why Aristotle says we become courageous by doing courageous things. There's also the role of *phronesis* (practical wisdom) — the ability to perceive what a situation demands, which can't be reduced to a formula.

Confucian ethics is a parallel tradition of virtue ethics. The *junzi* (exemplary person) cultivates *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (ritual propriety), and *zhi* (wisdom). Like Aristotle, Confucius emphasizes moral formation through practice and habituation within a community of relationships.

The modern revival of virtue ethics, led by Elizabeth Anscombe, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Philippa Foot, arose from frustration with the thinness of rule-based ethics. Rules tell you what to do, but they don't tell you what kind of life is worth living — and that, virtue ethicists argue, is the real question.
