Virtue is excellence of character — what emerges when ethical principles are internalized through empathy and practice until they become second nature. A virtuous person doesn't just follow rules; they are naturally inclined toward goodness.

For the ancient Greeks, virtue (arete) was the central question of ethics. Socrates asked whether virtue could be taught. Plato identified four cardinal virtues: wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. Aristotle argued that virtue is a "golden mean" between extremes — courage lies between cowardice and recklessness, generosity between stinginess and wastefulness. In Chinese philosophy, Confucius taught that virtue (de) is cultivated through ritual practice, study, and self-reflection. Across traditions, the message is similar: virtue isn't something you're born with — it's something you build.
