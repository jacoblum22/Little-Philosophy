Virtue is excellence of character — the quality of being naturally inclined toward goodness, not because you're following rules, but because right action has become second nature through practice and habit.

For the ancient Greeks, virtue (arete) was the central question of ethics. Socrates asked whether virtue could be taught. Plato identified four cardinal virtues: wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. Aristotle argued that virtue is a "golden mean" between extremes — courage lies between cowardice and recklessness, generosity between stinginess and wastefulness. In Chinese philosophy, Confucius taught that virtue (de) is cultivated through ritual practice, study, and self-reflection. Across traditions, the message is similar: virtue isn't something you're born with — it's something you build.
