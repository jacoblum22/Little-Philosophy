Virtue is the quality of character that makes someone not just capable but *good* — the inner disposition to act well, consistently, in the situations life throws at you.

Modern ethics tends to focus on actions: which ones are right? which ones are wrong? Virtue ethics asks a different question: what kind of person should you *be*? The right action flows naturally from the right character, and character is built through practice — not through memorizing rules.

Aristotle gave the classical account. Virtue (*aretē*) is a stable disposition to feel and act in the right way, at the right time, toward the right people, for the right reasons. It's a mean between two extremes: courage is the virtue between cowardice and recklessness, generosity between stinginess and wastefulness. Finding the mean isn't a mathematical calculation — it requires *phronesis* (practical wisdom), the ability to perceive what a specific situation demands.

Crucially, virtue is a habit, not a moment. You don't become courageous by performing one brave act; you become courageous by repeatedly acting bravely until it becomes second nature. Aristotle compared it to learning a musical instrument: you become a good lyre-player by playing the lyre, and you become virtuous by practicing virtue. This means character formation is central to ethics — how you're raised, what habits you develop, what role models you follow.

Confucian ethics reaches similar conclusions through a different path. The *junzi* (exemplary person) cultivates *ren* (benevolence), *yi* (righteousness), *li* (propriety), and *zhi* (wisdom) through constant practice, self-reflection, and relational attunement. Virtue isn't something you have; it's something you do, over and over, in the context of your relationships.

The Stoics redefined virtue as the only genuine good — the only thing that can't be taken away from you. Wealth, health, even life itself are "indifferents." Only the quality of your character is truly up to you, and therefore only character truly matters.

Modern virtue ethics, revived by thinkers like Alasdair MacIntyre, Elizabeth Anscombe, and Philippa Foot, argues that the Enlightenment emphasis on rules and consequences lost something crucial: the insight that ethics is fundamentally about becoming a certain kind of person, not just about following principles.
