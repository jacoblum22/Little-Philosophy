Vision is the capacity to see beyond what is to what could be — to perceive possibilities that aren't yet actual, futures that don't yet exist, ideals that haven't yet been realized. It's imagination directed at the real: not fantasy or escapism, but transformative seeing.

Philosophically, vision operates on multiple levels. In epistemology, vision is the dominant metaphor for knowledge — we speak of "insight," "illumination," "the light of reason," and "seeing the truth." Plato's allegory of the Cave is fundamentally about vision: the prisoners see only shadows until one escapes into the sunlight and sees reality itself. The metaphor of knowledge as seeing runs so deep in Western thought that it's almost invisible.

In ethics and politics, vision means the ability to articulate a compelling picture of how things ought to be. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech is vision in action: it makes the listener *see* a world that doesn't yet exist but could. Prophetic traditions in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are built on vision — the prophet sees what others cannot and calls the community to account.

But vision has its dangers. The visionary can become the fanatic — so intoxicated by their picture of the ideal that they ride roughshod over the actual. Isaiah Berlin warned against "procrustean" thinkers who try to force messy human reality into the neat framework of their vision. The challenge is to hold vision and realism together: to see clearly both what is and what ought to be, without letting either overwhelm the other.
