War is organized, large-scale violence between groups — and the philosophical question is whether it can ever be justified, and if so, under what conditions.

Heraclitus called war "the father of all things," and there's a grim truth to it: war has shaped borders, overthrown empires, ended slavery, and triggered technological revolutions. But the cost is measured in bodies. The 20th century alone saw roughly 100 million war deaths. Philosophy's task is not to romanticize war but to think clearly about when violence is justified and how it should be constrained.

The *just war* tradition, developed primarily by Augustine, Aquinas, and later refined by thinkers like Michael Walzer, establishes two sets of criteria. *Jus ad bellum* (justice of going to war) requires just cause (usually self-defense or defense of innocents), legitimate authority, right intention, proportionality, reasonable chance of success, and last resort. *Jus in bello* (justice in the conduct of war) requires distinction between combatants and civilians, proportionality in the use of force, and humane treatment of prisoners.

Pacifists reject the entire framework. The most consistent philosophical pacifists — Tolstoy, Gandhi, certain Quaker and Buddhist traditions — argue that violence always breeds more violence, that the means corrupt the ends, and that nonviolent resistance is both morally superior and often more effective. Gandhi's independence movement and King's civil rights campaign demonstrated that nonviolence can succeed against apparently overwhelming force.

Clausewitz famously defined war as "the continuation of politics by other means," treating it as a rational instrument of state policy. But war has a way of exceeding rational control — the "fog of war," the escalation dynamics, the dehumanization of the enemy, the way soldiers and civilians alike become caught in machinery they cannot stop.

In the nuclear age, the philosophical question intensifies. If a war carries the risk of annihilating civilization, no cause could justify it — which is why nuclear deterrence is built on a paradox: threatening what you must never be willing to do.
