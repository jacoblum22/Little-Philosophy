Wealth is the accumulation of valuable resources — money, land, goods, or any form of material abundance. It seems straightforward, but the philosophical questions around wealth are among the most consequential ever asked: What does wealth do to people? Who deserves it? How much is too much?

Aristotle distinguished between a natural form of wealth-getting (acquiring enough to live well) and an unnatural form (accumulating money without limit). The natural form has a stopping point — you need enough food, shelter, and goods for a good life, and then you're done. The unnatural form (what he called *chrematistike*) is pathological: it mistakes the means of living for the purpose of living. This distinction anticipates modern critiques of consumerism and infinite economic growth.

The Stoics and Epicureans both argued that wealth is, at best, morally neutral. Epictetus, a former slave, insisted that freedom has nothing to do with external possessions. Seneca, one of the richest men in Rome, struggled with the contradiction — but argued that wealth is dangerous not in itself but because of the attachment it creates. The Buddhist concept of non-attachment makes the same point: it's not money that causes suffering but *clinging* to money.

Marx argued that wealth under capitalism is produced socially but owned privately — the workers create value, but the owners capture it. The justice of this arrangement is the central dispute between capitalism and its critics. Rawls's *A Theory of Justice* argued that inequality is acceptable only if it benefits the worst-off members of society. The philosophical conversation about wealth is really a conversation about what we owe each other and what kind of society we want to build.
