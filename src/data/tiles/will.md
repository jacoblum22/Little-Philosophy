The will is the capacity to choose and to act on that choice — the inner force that translates intention into deed, desire into decision.

The concept has a long and tangled history. For Augustine, the will was the decisive faculty: it was not ignorance that made us sin but a corrupt will. You can know what's right and still choose wrong — this is the will's terrible freedom. Augustine's struggle with his own will (“Grant me chastity and continence, but not yet”) became one of the most honest pieces of philosophical autobiography ever written.

Kant made the will central to morality. A good will, he argued, is the only thing that is good without qualification — not intelligence, not talent, not happiness, but the determination to act from duty. The moral law is not something imposed on us from outside; it's something the rational will imposes on itself. This is autonomy in Kant's strong sense: self-legislation.

Schopenhauer took the concept in a radically different direction. For him, will is not a rational faculty but a blind, irrational force — the fundamental reality behind all appearances. The entire universe is will: the force that drives plants toward sunlight, animals toward food, humans toward desire after desire. Consciousness is just will's way of seeing itself. Nietzsche transformed Schopenhauer's pessimistic will into the "will to power" — not merely the desire to dominate, but the creative drive to overcome, to grow, to become more than what you are.

The deepest puzzle about will is whether it's genuinely free. If your decisions are caused by prior brain states (which were caused by prior brain states, all the way back), then the will is just the experience of watching a chain of dominoes fall. But if the will is uncaused — genuinely spontaneous — how is that freedom rather than randomness? The feeling of willing seems undeniable; the reality of it remains disputed.
