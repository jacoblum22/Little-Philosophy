Wisdom is one of those words everyone uses but few can define. It's not the same as intelligence, and it's not the same as knowledge. You can know a thousand facts and still be foolish. Wisdom is something deeper — a kind of practical understanding of what matters, how to live, and how to navigate the complexity of being human.

The ancient Greeks distinguished between *sophia* (theoretical wisdom — understanding the deepest truths) and *phronesis* (practical wisdom — knowing what to do in particular situations). Aristotle considered phronesis especially important: it's the ability to perceive the right thing to do in messy, complicated circumstances where no rule can guide you. A wise person doesn't just follow principles mechanically — they know when to apply which principle, and when to make exceptions.

Across cultures, wisdom is associated with age, experience, and a certain humility. The Tao Te Ching teaches that the wise person acts without forcing, speaks without lecturing, and leads without dominating. Socrates famously claimed that his only wisdom was knowing how much he didn't know. Perhaps wisdom begins not with answers, but with the recognition that the most important questions resist easy answers.
