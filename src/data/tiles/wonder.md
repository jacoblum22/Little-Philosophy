Wonder is the feeling of awe and puzzlement that strikes when you look at the world carefully and realize how strange and astonishing it all is. Why is there something rather than nothing? Why do things behave the way they do? What am I?

Aristotle and Plato both said that philosophy begins in wonder — the sense of awe and puzzlement that drives us to ask questions. Wonder is not confusion or ignorance; it's the active recognition that the world is more mysterious than it first appears. It's the spark that ignites all inquiry, the feeling that turns an ordinary person into a philosopher.
