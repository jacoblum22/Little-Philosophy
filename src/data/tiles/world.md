The world is everything that exists beyond your own mind — nature, objects, other people, the cosmos itself. It's the stage on which all of life unfolds.

But here's the puzzle: we never experience the world directly. Everything we know about it comes filtered through our senses, our language, our assumptions. So when we talk about "the world," are we talking about what's really out there, or just our picture of it? This question — the gap between the world as it is and the world as we experience it — is one of the oldest and most persistent in philosophy.
