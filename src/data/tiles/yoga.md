Yoga is one of the oldest systematic approaches to self-transformation in human history — a set of practices aimed at integrating body, mind, and spirit. The word comes from the Sanskrit *yuj*, meaning "to yoke" or "to unite," and its goal is nothing less than the realization of one's true nature.

In the West, yoga is often associated with physical postures (*asanas*), but this is only one small piece of a vast philosophical system. Patanjali's *Yoga Sutras* (compiled around the 2nd century CE) define yoga as "the stilling of the changing states of the mind" (*chitta vritti nirodha*). The eight "limbs" of Patanjali's system include ethical precepts (*yama* and *niyama*), physical discipline (*asana*), breath control (*pranayama*), sensory withdrawal (*pratyahara*), concentration (*dharana*), meditation (*dhyana*), and finally *samadhi* — a state of absorption in which the distinction between knower and known dissolves.

Yoga appears in the *Bhagavad Gita* as well, where Krishna teaches Arjuna three paths: *karma yoga* (the yoga of selfless action), *jnana yoga* (the yoga of knowledge), and *bhakti yoga* (the yoga of devotion). Each offers a different route to liberation, suited to different temperaments. The Gita's genius is in presenting these not as competing alternatives but as complementary dimensions of a lived spiritual practice.

Philosophically, yoga raises deep questions about the relationship between body and mind. If physical postures and breathing exercises can transform consciousness, what does that say about the supposed separation of mental and physical? Yoga suggests they are far more intertwined than Western dualism typically assumes — that the body is not a prison for the soul but a vehicle for awakening.
